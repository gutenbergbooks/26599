<h2><a name="TO_MY_READERS" id="TO_MY_READERS"></a>TO MY READERS.</h2>

<p>I do not know how better to use the space that
the printer always leaves me in this part of the book
than to redeem the promise I made at the end of my
last novel, and tell you in a few words what became
of Blanche Brixton Fantelli and her husband.</p>

<p>But, do you really need to be told?</p>

<p>Could they have done anything else than live in
connubial felicity, after the man had proved himself
so noble and the woman had learned to appreciate
him at his true worth?</p>

<p>Well, whether they could or not, they didn't.
Blanche is the happiest of wedded wives. She still
holds to her theory that marriage is based on wrong
principles, and that the contract as ordinarily made
is frightfully immoral; but she says if all men were
like "her Jules" there would be no trouble.</p>

<p>In this she proves herself essentially feminine. She
is learning, albeit a little late, that man was not
made to live alone, and that the love a mother feels
for her child is not the only one that brings joy to a
woman's breast.</p>

<p>Fantelli does not claim that Blanche is his property.
He is her lover still, even though he has
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[viii]</a></span>gained the law's permission to be her master. He
recognizes that she has rights in herself that are inviolable.
This is why they live together so contentedly.
She would not be his mate on any other
terms.</p>

<p>If it is not the ideal existence, it is very near it.
As near as a man and woman who care for the
world's opinion can live it in these days.</p>

<p>And now, with heartfelt thanks for the continued
favor of the reading public, which I am conscious is
far beyond my desert, I bid a temporary farewell to
American shores. By the time this book is on the
shelves of the dealers I shall be on European soil,
there to remain, I trust, for the better part of a year.
Wherever I am, my thoughts will always turn to you
who have made these journeys possible, and there as
here my pen will continue devoted to your service.</p>

<h3>A REJECTED MANUSCRIPT.</h3>

<p>"A letter for Mr. Roseleaf," he heard his landlady
say to the chambermaid. And he was quite prepared
to hear the girl reply, in a tone of surprise:</p>

<p>"For Mr. Roseleaf! This is the first letter he
has had since he came."</p>

<p>The young man referred to stood just within his
chamber door, waiting with some anxiety for the
letter to be brought to him. He was about twenty
years of age, of medium height, with rather dark
complexion, curling hair and expressive eyes, and
with a natural delicacy of manner that made him
seem almost feminine at first view.</p>

<p>He had the greatest possible interest in the letter
that the postman had just brought, but he was far
too polite to disturb the landlady or her servant,
who were not yet through with it.</p>

<p>"You can see that it is from a publishing house,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
commented Mrs. Ranning, inspecting the envelope
with care. "It is from Cutt &amp; Slashem, who bring
out more novels than any other firm in the city. I
told you he was some kind of a writer. Perhaps
they are going to publish a book for him! If they
do he will leave us for finer quarters. Novelists
make a mint of money, I have heard. We must do
our best to keep him as long as we can. Be very
polite to him, Nellie. He appears to be an excellent
young man."</p>

<p>Shirley Roseleaf's anxiety to get possession of his
letter was not lessened by this conversation. It
seemed as if his entire future hung on the contents
of that envelope tarrying so long in Nellie's hands.
The great publishers, Cutt &amp; Slashem, had had a
manuscript of his in their hands for nearly a fortnight.
When they had definitely accepted it, his
path would be perfectly clear. If they rejected it&mdash;but
he had not got so far as that.</p>

<p>The manuscript was a romance&mdash;a romance of
love! Its author had spent a great deal of time
upon it. He had rewritten it with care, and finally
made a neat copy, of which he was very proud.
Then he had thought a long time over the question
of a publishing firm. Cutt &amp; Slashem stood at the
top of their profession, and they finally received the
preference. With the MSS. Roseleaf sent a pretty
note, in which he included a delicate compliment on
their success. The MSS. and the note were arranged
tastefully in a neat white package and tied with pink
twine.</p>

<p>After all of those precautions it is no wonder that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>the novelist felt surprise when days passed and no
reply was sent to him. But never at any time was
he discouraged. Had they intended to reject the
novel, he reasoned, they could as easily have done
so in three days as ten.</p>

<p>He pictured the members of the firm hugging
themselves over their good fortune, passing the
manuscript from one to the other, all eager for a
taste of such a marvelous work. He did not think
it egotism to believe they did not get stories like
that every day.</p>

<p>His thoughts flew rapidly as Nellie slowly climbed
the stairs. Now he would be famous, he would be
courted, he would be envied! He would also be
very, very rich, though that was not of so much
account.</p>

<p>As Nellie handed him the letter he responded to
her pleasant smile with one of his own, and even
pressed a twenty-five cent piece into her hand. Then
he closed his door behind him, bolting it in his
eagerness to be alone. The morning was foggy, and
he sank into a chair by the window, the only part of
the room where he could see to read distinctly.</p>

<p>There was an attraction about the envelope. It
was light buff in color, bearing the address of Cutt
&amp; Slashem in large letter on one side of the front
face, besides the names of several of the most famous
authors whose publishers the firm had the happiness
to be.</p>

<p>"Shirley Roseleaf!" It would not look so badly
in print.</p>

<p>So lost was he in the pleasant pictures which
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>these thoughts conjured up that it was some
minutes before he tore open the envelope. Then his
astounded eyes rested upon these lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Messrs. Cutt &amp; Slashem regret to be obliged to decline
with thanks the MSS. of M. Shirley Roseleaf, and request to
be informed what disposition he desires made of the same."</p></div>

<p>Roseleaf read this dizzily. For some moments he
could not understand what that sentence meant.
"Obliged to decline" was plain enough; but his
confused mind found some grains of comfort in the
request of the firm to know what he wished done
with his manuscript. They must, he reasoned, consider
it of value, or they would not respond in that
courteous manner. Still, he could not comprehend
how they had had the asininity to "decline" it
at all.</p>

<p>Were they unwilling to add another star to their
galaxy?</p>

<p>Could they actually have read the tale?</p>

<p>A firm of their reputation, too!</p>

<p>When Roseleaf emerged from his temporary stupor
it was into a state of great indignation. Why, the
men were fools! He wished heartily he had never
gone to them. They would yet see the day when,
with tears in their eyes, they would regret their lack
of judgment. His first act should be to go to their
office and express his opinion of their stupidity, and
then he would take his MSS. to some rival house.
And never, never in the world&mdash;after he had become
famous, and when every publisher on both sides of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>the Atlantic were besieging him&mdash;never, he said,
should these ignorant fellows get a scrap of his writing,
not even if they offered its weight in gold!</p>

<p>He was too excited for delay, and donning his hat,
he took his way with all speed to Cutt &amp; Slashem's
office. At that instant he had more faith in his
novel than ever. As he walked rapidly along he
compared it with some of the stories issued by the
firm that had rejected it, to the great disadvantage
of the latter.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Cutt or Mr. Slashem," he said,
imperiously, as he entered the counting room.</p>

<p>"Both are in," said the office boy, imperturbably.
"Which will you have?"</p>

<p>"I will see them together."</p>

<p>Had they been tigers, fresh from an Indian jungle,
it would have made no difference to him.</p>

<p>The boy asked for his card, vanished with it,
returned and bade him follow. Up a flight of stairs
they went, then to the left, then to the right, then
across a little hall. A door with the name of the
house and the additional word "Private" loomed
before them.</p>

<p>"Come in!" was heard in response to the knock
of the office boy.</p>

<p>Roseleaf entered, something slower than a cannon
ball, and yet considerably faster than a snail. The
two principal members of the firm were sitting
together, with lighted cigars in their mouths, examining
a lot of paper samples that lay upon a table.
They did no more at first than glance up and nod,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>not having finished the business upon which they
were engaged.</p>

<p>"Is it any better than the last?" asked Mr. Slashem,
referring to the sample his partner was examining.</p>

<p>"It's just as good, at least," was the answer. "And
an eighth of a cent a pound less. I think we had better
order five hundred reams."</p>

<p>"Five hundred reams," repeated the other, slowly,
making a memorandum in a little book that he carried.
"And the other lot we'll wait about, eh?
Paper is not very steady. It's gone off a sixteenth
since Thursday."</p>

<p>This conversation only served to infuriate still more
the visitor who stood waiting to pour out his wrath.
Were these men wasting time over fractions of a cent
in the price of stock, just after they had rejected one
of the greatest romances of modern times!</p>

<p>With the precision of a duplex machine both partners
finally looked up from the table at the young
man.</p>

<p>"Mr. Shirley Roseleaf?" said Mr. Slashem, interrogatively,
glancing at the card that the office boy
had brought.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir!" was the sharp and disdainful reply.</p>

<p>"We need nothing in your line," interrupted Mr.
Cutt. "I suppose Mr. Trimm has our other order
well under way?"</p>

<p>The look of indignant protest that appeared in
Roseleaf's face caused Mr. Slashem to speak.</p>

<p>"This is not Mr. Roseberg," he explained. "My
partner took you for an agent of our bookbinder," he
added.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>The novelist thought his skin would burst.</p>

<p>"I am quite complimented," he said, in an icy
tone. "Let me introduce myself. I am the author
of 'Evelyn's Faith.'"</p>

<p>The partners consulted each other.</p>

<p>"The similarity of names confused me," said Mr.
Cutt. "Is your book one that we have published?"</p>

<p>Saints and angels!</p>

<p>"It is one that was sent to you <i>for</i> publication,"
replied Roseleaf, with much heat, "and has been
returned this morning&mdash;<i>rejected</i>!"</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Mr. Cutt.</p>

<p>"We have nothing to do with that department,"
said Mr. Slashem, coming to the rescue. "You
should see Mr. Gouger, on the second floor above;
though if he has rejected your story a visit would be
quite useless. He never decides a matter without
sufficient reason."</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, no!" added Mr. Cutt, feeling again of
the paper samples.</p>

<p>Shirley Roseleaf listened with wild incredulity.</p>

<p>"Do you mean to tell me," he said, "that you, the
members of the firm of Cutt &amp; Slashem, have rejected
my story without even reading it?"</p>

<p>The partners glanced at each other again.</p>

<p>"We never read books," said Mr. Cutt.</p>

<p>"Never," said Mr. Slashem, kindly. "We have
things much more important to attend to. We pay
Mr. Gouger a large salary. Why, my young friend,
there are probably a dozen manuscripts received at
our office every week. If we were to try to <i>read</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
them, who do you think would attend to the <i>essential</i>
points of our business?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf's contempt for the concern was increasing
at lightning speed. He did not care to mince his
words, for it could make no difference now.</p>

<p>"I should imagine that the selection of the books
you are to print would be at least as important as
the paper you are to use," he retorted.</p>

<p>Mr. Cutt looked at him in great astonishment.</p>

<p>"You are much mistaken," said he.</p>

<p>"Entirely mistaken," confirmed Mr. Slashem.</p>

<p>The author had no desire to remain longer, as it
was evident he was losing his temper to no purpose.
If it was Mr. Gouger who had rejected his work, it
was Mr. Gouger that he must see.</p>

<p>Bowing with ironical grace to the examiners of
printing paper, he took leave of them, and mounted
to the sanctum of the man who he had been told was
the arbiter of his fate. A girl with soiled hands
pointed out the room, for there was nothing to indicate
it upon the dingy panel of the door; and
presently Roseleaf stood in the presence of the individual
he believed at that moment his worst enemy.</p>

<p>There were two men in the room. One of them
indicated with a motion of his hand that the other
was the one wanted, and with a second motion that
the caller might be seated. Mr. Gouger was partly
hidden behind a desk, engaged in turning over a
heap of manuscript, and it appeared from the manner
of his companion that he did not wish to be
disturbed.</p>

<p>Somewhat cooled down by this state of affairs,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>the young novelist took the chair indicated and
waited several minutes.</p>

<p>"What d&mdash;d nonsense they are sending me these
days!" exclaimed Mr. Gouger at last, thrusting the
sheets he had been scanning back into the wrapper
in which they had come, without, however, raising
his eyes from his desk. "Out of a hundred stories
I read, not three are fit to build a fire with! This
thing is written by a girl who ought to take a term
in a grammar school. She has no more idea of
syntax than a lapdog. Her father writes that he is
willing to pay a reasonable sum to have it brought
out. Why, Cutt &amp; Slashem couldn't afford to put
their imprint on that rot for fifty thousand dollars!"</p>

<p>He had finished saying this before he learned that
a third person was in the room. Upon making this
discovery he lowered his voice, as if regretting having
exhibited too great warmth before a stranger.
The novelist rose and handed him a card, and as
Mr. Gouger glanced at the name a gleam of recognition
lit up his face.</p>

<p>"I am glad to see you, Mr. Roseleaf," he said.
"I had half a notion to ask you to call, when I felt
obliged to send you that note yesterday. There are
several things I would like to say to you. Archie,
perhaps you would let us have the room for a few
minutes."</p>

<p>The last remark was addressed familiarly to the
man who occupied the third chair, and who looked
so disheartened at the prospect of having to rise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>therefrom that Roseleaf hastened to express a hope
that he would not do so on his account.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Gouger, abruptly. "You
heard what I said about this copy I have just read,
though it was not my intention that you should. I
supposed I was talking only to Mr. Weil, who is not
in the profession and does not expect to be. Now,
let me say at once, Mr. Roseleaf, that your contribution
is not open to any of the objections I have
cited. You have evidently been well educated. Your
English is pure and forcible. It is a real delight
to read your pages. Every line shows the greatest
care in construction. I did with your story what
I have not done with another for a long time&mdash;I read
it through. Why then did I reject it?"</p>

<p>The question was too great for the one most interested
to answer, but in the glow of pleasure that the
compliment brought he forgot for the moment his
bitter feelings.</p>

<p>"Possibly," he suggested, "Cutt &amp; Slashem have
more novels on hand than they feel like producing at
present."</p>

<p>"No," responded Mr. Gouger, disposing of that
theory in one breath. "A house like ours would
never reject a really desirable manuscript. If you
will reflect that only one or two of this description
are produced each year you will the more readily
understand me. Your story has a cardinal fault for
which no excellence of style or finish can compensate.
Shall I tell you what it is, and before this gentleman?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>

<p>He indicated Mr. Weil as he spoke. Roseleaf's
heart sank. For the first time he felt a deadly fear.</p>

<p>"Tell me, by all means," he responded, faintly.</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger's face bore its gentlest expression at
that moment. He was taking valuable time, time
that belonged to his employers, to say something
that must temporarily disappoint, though in the end
it might benefit his hearer.</p>

<p>"Let me repeat," he said, "that your work is well
written, and that I have read it with the greatest
interest. Its fault&mdash;an insuperable one&mdash;is that it
lacks fidelity to nature. Mr. Roseleaf, I think I could
gauge your past life with tolerable accuracy merely
from what that manuscript reveals."</p>

<p>The novelist shook his head. There was not a line
of autobiography in those pages, and he told his
critic so.</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand," replied Mr. Gouger. "But
this I have learned: Your life has been marvelously
colorless. Yet, in spite of that, you have undertaken
to write of things of which you know nothing, and
about which, I may add, you have made very poor
guesses."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil, leaning back in his chair, began to show
a decided interest. Mr. Roseleaf, sitting upright, in
an attitude of strained attention, inquired what Mr.
Gouger meant.</p>

<p>"Well, for instance, this," responded the critic:
"You attempt to depict the sensations of love,
though you have never had a passion. Can you
expect to know how it feels to hold a beautiful girl in
your arms, when you never had one there? You put
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>words of temptation into the mouth of your villain
which no real scamp would think of using, for their
only effect would be to alarm your heroine. You
talk of a planned seduction as if it were part of an
oratorio. And you make your hero so superlatively
pure and sweet that no woman formed of flesh and
blood could endure him for an hour."</p>

<p>The color mounted to Roseleaf's face. He felt
that this criticism was not without foundation. But
presently he rallied, and asked if it were necessary
for a man to experience every sensation before he
dared write about them.</p>

<p>"Do you suppose," he asked, desperately, "that
Jules Verne ever traveled sixty thousand leagues
under the sea or made a journey to the moon?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil could not help uttering a little laugh.
Mr. Gouger struck his hands together and clinched
them.</p>

<p>"No," said he. "But he could have written
neither of those wonderful tales without a knowledge
of the sciences of which they treat."</p>

<p>"He has read, and I have read," responded Roseleaf.
"What is the difference?"</p>

<p>"He has studied, and you have not," retorted the
critic. "That makes all the difference in the world.
He has a correct idea of the structure of the moon
and what should be found in the unexplored caverns
of the ocean; while you, in total ignorance, have
attempted to deal in a science to which these are the
merest bagatelles! You know as little of the tides
that control the heart of a girl as you do of the personal
history of the inhabitants of Jupiter! Your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>powers of description are good; those of invention
feeble. Either throw yourself into a love affair, till
you have learned it root and branch, or never again
try to depict one."</p>

<p>Mr. Archie Weil smiled and nodded, as if he entirely
agreed with the speaker.</p>

<p>"What a novel <i>I</i> could make, my dear fellow!"
he exclaimed, "if I only had the talent. I have had
experiences enough, but I could no more write them
out than I could fly."</p>

<p>"It is quite as well," was the response, "your
women would all be Messalinas and fiction has too
many now."</p>

<p>"Not <i>all</i> of them, Lawrence," was the quick and
meaning reply.</p>

<p>"In that case," said Gouger, "I wish heartily you
could write. The world is famishing for a real
love story, based on modern lines, brought up to
date. I tell you, there has been nothing satisfactory
in that line since Goethe's day."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil suggested Balzac and Sand.</p>

<p>"Why don't you include George William Reynolds?"
inquired Gouger, with a sneer. "Neither
of them wrote until they were depraved by contract
with humanity. If we could get a young man of
true literary talent to see life and write of it as he
went along, what might we not secure? But I have
no more time to spare, Mr. Roseleaf. I was sorry
to be obliged to reject your story. Some day, when
you have seen just a little of the world, begin again
on the lines I have outlined, and come here with the
result."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>Quite dispirited, now that the last plank had
slipped from under him, the novelist walked slowly
down the stairs. He did not even ask for his manuscript.
After what he had heard, it did not seem
worth carrying to his lodgings. His plans were
shipwrecked. Instead of the fame and fortune he
had hoped for, he felt the most bitter disappointment.
All his bright dreams had vanished.</p>

<p>A step behind him quicker than his own, made
him aware that some one was following him, and
presently a voice called his name. It was Mr.
Archie Weil, who had put himself to unusual exertion,
and required some seconds to recover his
breath before he could speak further.</p>

<p>"I want you to come over to my hotel and have a
little talk with me," he said. "Gouger has interested
me in you immensely. I believe, as he says,
that you have the making of a distinguished author,
and I want to arrange a plan by which you can carry
out his scheme."</p>

<p>Mr. Roseleaf stared doubtfully at his companion.</p>

<p>"What scheme?" he said, briefly.</p>

<p>"Why, of imparting to you that knowledge of the
world which will enable you to draw truthful portraits.
You have the art, he says, the talent, the
capacity&mdash;whatever you choose to call it. All you
lack is experience. Given that, you would make
a reputation second to none. What can be plainer
than that you should acquire the thing you need
without delay?"</p>

<p>"The 'thing I need'?" repeated Roseleaf, dolefully.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weil laughed, delightfully.</p>

<p>"Yes!" he explained. "What you need is a friend
able to interest you, to begin with. Pardon me if I
say I may be described by that phrase. Come to
my hotel a little while and let us talk it over."</p>

<p>It was not an opportunity to be refused, in Roseleaf's
depressed condition, and the two men walked
together to the Hoffman House, where Mr. Weil at
that time made his home.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II.</h2>

<h3>"WAS MY STORY TOO BOLD?"</h3>


<p>"Well, Millie, your letter has come," said Mr. Wilton
Fern, as he entered the parlor of his pleasant
residence, situated about twenty miles from the
limits of New York City. "Open it as quick as you
can, and learn your fate."</p>

<p>His daughter started nervously from her seat near
the window, where she had been spending the previous
hour in speculations regarding the very missive
that was now placed in her hands. She was a handsome
girl, neither blonde nor brunette, with eyes of
hazel gray and hair of that color that moderns call
Titian red. She took the envelope that her father
gave her, and though she wanted intensely to know
the contents she hesitated to open it.</p>

<p>"Read it, Millie," smiled Mr. Fern. "Let us learn
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>whether we have an authoress in our house who is
destined to become famous."</p>

<p>But this remark made Miss Millicent less willing
than before to open the letter in her father's presence.
She slowly left the room without answering
and did not break the seal of her communication till
she was in the seclusion of her chamber.</p>

<p>And it was quite a while, even then, before she
summoned the necessary courage. Some days previous
she had sent a MSS. to the great publishing
house of Cutt &amp; Slashem. The writing had taken
up the best of her time for a year. She had high
hopes that it was destined to lay the foundation
of an artistic success. Her plot was novel, not
to say startling. It was entirely out of the conventional
order. It would be certain to arouse
talk and provoke comment, if it got into print;
and to make sure that it <i>would</i> get into print she
had persuaded her father to write a little note,
which she enclosed with the MSS., saying that
he would pay a cash bonus, if the firm demanded it,
to guarantee them against possible loss.</p>

<p>With this note in her mind, Miss Millicent had
felt little doubt that her story would be accepted
and printed. She only wondered how warmly they
would praise her work. It was not enough to have
them print it; she wanted something to justify her
in saying to her father, "There, you see I was not
wrong after all in thinking I could have a literary
career!"</p>

<p>At last the envelope was removed, and the girl's
astonished eyes lit upon this cold, dry statement:</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Messrs. Cutt &amp; Slashem regret to be obliged to decline
with thanks the MSS. of Miss M. Fern, and request to be
informed what disposition she desires made of the
same."</p></div>

<p>Millicent felt a ringing in her ears. Her hands
grew clammy. A dull pain pressed on her forehead.
She felt a faintness, a sinking at the heart. Was it
possible she had read aright? Rejected, in this
cruel way, without even a reference to her father's
offer! It was atrocious, and, girl-like, she burst into
a spasm of weeping.</p>

<p>How could she ever face her father? The sacrifices
she had made came back to her, sacrifices of
which she had thought little at the time, but which
now seemed gigantic. There had been nights when
she had not gone to bed till three, other nights when
she had been too full of her subject to sleep and had
risen in the small hours to finish some particularly
interesting chapter. Twelve hundred pages there
were in all, note size, in her large, round, almost
masculine hand. And this time was all lost! She
had mistaken her vocation. The greatest publishing
house in the country had decided against her.</p>

<p>Gradually she dried her eyes. It would do no
good to weep. She read the curt answer that had
come in the mail, a dozen times. Why could not
the firm have sent her a reason, an excuse that
meant something? She wanted to know wherein
her fault lay. It might be possible to correct it.
Perhaps the state of business was to blame. The
more she thought, the more determined she grew to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>investigate this strange affair, and within an hour
she had donned her street clothes and started, without
saying anything to the rest of the household of
her intention, for the office of Cutt &amp; Slashem in the
city.</p>

<p>She knew that each large concern had one or more
"readers," on whose judgment they relied in such
matters. She, therefore, paused only long enough
at the counting-room to get directed to Mr. Gouger.
Her knock on the critic's door brought forth a loud
"Come in," and as she entered she saw two men
standing with hats in their hand, as if about to take
their departure.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon," she said, "but I wish to see
Mr. Gouger."</p>

<p>"That is my name," responded one of the men,
stepping forward.</p>

<p>"I am Miss Fern."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger did not seem very glad to hear it.
The hour of one had just struck, and he was about
to go to his lunch. He recognized the girl's name,
as that of the author of the MSS. he had criticized
so severely to his friend, Weil, who was, by-the-way,
the third person in the room at this moment. Had
she sent up her card, as is usual with women, he
would have avoided seeing her at any hazard.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil took a long survey of the young lady,
and then retired to the vicinity of the front windows.
He pretended to interest himself in the rush of
traffic that was going on in the street below, but he
missed nothing of what was said, and stole from
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>time to time a glance at his two companions, particularly
the younger one.</p>

<p>"A mighty pretty girl," was his mental comment.
"I hope Lawrence isn't going to be nasty with her."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger motioned Miss Fern rather stiffly to a
seat.</p>

<p>"I do not wish to detain you," she said, with
feminine inconsistency, as she accepted it. "I only
want to know, if you will be so kind as to tell me,
what is the trouble with my story."</p>

<p>The critic was pleased at one thing. Miss Fern's
voice was reasonably clear. She had finished her
weeping at home. There was to be no scene, something
he dreaded, and in the course of his connection
with this house he had experienced scores of them.
He inspected his caller critically in the few seconds
that elapsed while she was asking this question, and
when she paused he decided to answer her with as
much of the truth as he dared use.</p>

<p>"The fact is," he began, "a firm like ours is unable
to use more than one novel out of fifty that is
submitted to it. Of our friends who send us manuscripts,
the vast majority must, therefore, be disappointed.
Now, your story&mdash;shall I be frank?"</p>

<p>"By all means," answered Miss Fern.</p>

<p>"Your story, though written with spirit and
power, needs a great deal of revision from a&mdash;from
a rhetorical standpoint. It is, in fact, carelessly put
together. That is a cardinal fault in a literary production,
and one for which no amount of talent, or
even of genius, can compensate."</p>

<p>The girl listened with deep interest. She tried to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>think where the blemishes alluded to could be, for
she had read the story twenty times. To say nothing
of several girl friends, who had listened with
evident wonder and delight, to various parts of the
tale, as it progressed.</p>

<p>"If that is true," answered Miss Fern, slowly&mdash;,
"could not the trouble be remedied by sending the
MSS. to some very competent person and having the
errors made right?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger smiled.</p>

<p>"Hardly," he said. "A novel is like a painting.
The <i>ensemble</i>&mdash;do you understand?&mdash;is the thing.
Can you conceive a painting being 'done over'?
Your book would lose its quality if subjected to
that process."</p>

<p>A look of discouragement crossed the features of
the young woman.</p>

<p>"Of course, you know best," she stammered.
"What would you advise me&mdash;try again?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger raised both his hands.</p>

<p>"It is difficult to say, in such a case," he replied.
"But&mdash;if you want my best opinion&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That is just what I want," said the girl, with ill-concealed
impatience.</p>

<p>"You are not dependent upon your exertions, I
suppose, for a living?"</p>

<p>Millicent shook her head, almost sorry at the
moment that she could not reply in the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Then&mdash;I should give up the idea of being an
authoress."</p>

<p>This was very unpalatable medicine, and the critic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>realized it as he looked at the sombre face before
him.</p>

<p>"Is your rejection of my story based at all," asked
Miss Fern, after a pause, "on the&mdash;boldness of its
subject?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger smiled again.</p>

<p>"We publish the works of Hall Caine and George
Moore," he said. "I should not consider your story
overbold, if there was nothing else against it. It is
a wonder to me, and always will be, why such young
girls as you choose <i>risqu&eacute;</i> themes, but if the work is
well done the public will pay for it."</p>

<p>There was a slight blush on Miss Fern's face, partly
at the insinuation and partly at the adverse criticism
that had crept thoughtlessly into the sentence.</p>

<p>"For my part," she explained, "I wanted to write
something that would attract attention&mdash;that would
put my name prominently before the public and
keep it there. The girls I read it to thought the
scenes just lovely, though some said perhaps their
mothers would not feel that way. And I told
them that the mothers of to-day were very old-fashioned,
and that the public taste was changing
rapidly. If the story is too bold, there are things I
could cut out of it, but if you say that would make
no difference, I would rather let them stand. I
intend to try some other concern before I give
up."</p>

<p>Mr. Archie Weil had abandoned all pretence of
looking out the window. He stood with his eyes
fastened on the pretty girl, as she made these statements
in such a matter-of-fact way. He wondered
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>what the dickens the story was about, and made up
his mind that he would try to get possession of it.</p>

<p>"All the same," responded Mr. Gouger, who had
apparently forgotten his lunch in his growing
interest in the conversation, "I don't see where girls
like you obtain such an intimate knowledge of things.
You are not over twenty&mdash;excuse me, I am old
enough to tell you this without offence. It is not you
alone, but a hundred others who have made me
ask myself this question. As soon as the modern
girl gets a bottle of ink and a pen and begins
to let her thoughts flow over paper, it transpires
that she knows everything&mdash;more than everything,
almost. Why, I was twenty-five before I was as
wise as the heroine of sixteen, in this story of
yours!"</p>

<p>Miss Fern reddened again, all the more because
she had glanced up and encountered the bright eyes
of Mr. Weil fixed upon her.</p>

<p>"Why, Archie," pursued the literary man&mdash;he
turned toward Mr. Weil&mdash;"you remember Lelia
Dant&eacute;, you have seen her here. Five or six years
ago I got a letter from that young girl's mother
asking me to come to their residence and hear a
story she had written. It was her first one, and the
child was not a day over seventeen. I couldn't
believe it when she came into the room, with her
hair tumbled about her shoulders, and began to read
to me the first chapter of 'Zaros.' 'Did <i>she</i> write
that?' I asked her mother, incredulously. 'Certainly,'
she replied. 'Without aid from any one?'
'Absolutely alone.' My hair stood on end. I could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>not keep it down for the next week with a brush.
You know the story. We printed it, and it sold
well, and that is all that C. &amp; S. cared about it; but
I never understood how that infant could conceive
it. No more than I can understand your ability to
write this story of yours, Miss Fern," he added,
pointedly.</p>

<p>The young woman bridled a little.</p>

<p>"It does not matter much, if you are not going to
print it," she said, raising her eyes to his.</p>

<p>He bowed low to express whatever apology might
be necessary.</p>

<p>"I would have accepted it if I could," he said.
"My entire life is spent in reading manuscripts in
the hope of discovering one that will make a hit with
the public to whom we cater. When successful I
am as pleased as a South African who fishes a diamond
of the first water out of the mine. Your story,
Miss Fern, shows decided talent. You have a
greater knowledge of some of the important things
of life, I will wager, than your grandmother had
at eighty, if she lived so long. As I am obliged to
go now, let me add, without mincing matters, that
you are very deficient in English grammar, and that
nothing you can write will be acceptable to any
first-class house until that fault is remedied. Are
you ready, Archie?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil felt indignant. He could not have
spoken to any girl as pretty as this one in such
language, and he thought it quite inexcusable on
the part of his friend to do so. Mr. Gouger, though
feeling that it was best to use little circumlocution,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>had not meant to wound his caller. But her countenance
showed that he <i>had</i> wounded her, and the
natural gallantry of his younger companion came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>"I am not ready yet," said Mr. Weil, telegraphing
at the same time a series of signals with his eyes. "I
want a few minutes' talk with Miss Fern, if you will
introduce me. I think I can say something she will
like to hear."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger, who now stood in such a position
that Miss Fern could not see him, shook his head to
imply that he did not fancy this arrangement; but
he ended by saying, "Very well." He then abruptly
made the presentation, put on his hat, said good-by,
and vanished.</p>

<p>Miss Millicent, who had risen, turned with an air
of puzzled inquiry toward Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>"Be seated again, for a moment," he said, politely.
"I want your permission to read your story."</p>

<p>"Why, I don't know," she answered. "Are you
one of the employes of Cutt &amp; Slashem?"</p>

<p>He smilingly denied the imputation.</p>

<p>"I have not that felicity," he added, "but I am
much interested in things literary, and have a rather
wide acquaintance in this line of business. If I
could be allowed to read your MSS. perhaps I should
form a milder opinion of its faults than my unbending
friend. And in that case a word from me, to
another house, would certainly do you no harm."</p>

<p>A brighter light came into Miss Millicent's eyes.</p>

<p>"I shall be only too glad to have you read it," she
answered. "It is hard to believe that I have wasted
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>almost a year in something entirely worthless. You
may take it with pleasure."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil went to Mr. Gouger's desk, from which
he soon came with the parcel in question. He untied
the string and for a moment his gaze rested on
the handwriting.</p>

<p>"Do you live far from here?" he began; and then
added, as he noticed the address on an enclosed
card, "Ah, I see! At Midlands."</p>

<p>She explained herself rather more to him, giving
the full address of her father, and some particulars
about the manner in which she had been drawn into
attempting literary work. He listened intently, all
the time engaged in rapid thought.</p>

<p>"The best way for me to get a thoroughly correct
impression of this novel," he said, when she came to
a pause, "is to hear you read it aloud. In that manner,"
he added, as he saw that she was about to interrupt,
"a hundred meanings would come to the
surface that a mere inspection of the pages might fail
to show. Beside, there would be an opportunity
for discussion. If convenient to you I would gladly
come to your residence for this purpose."</p>

<p>The eyes of the young girl brightened. She was
greatly pleased at the idea and said so without delay.</p>

<p>"Very well," said Mr. Weil, more than delighted
with the success of his experiment. "To-day is
Tuesday; shall I come for the first time, say, Thursday
evening?"</p>

<p>"That would suit me perfectly; or to-morrow, if
you wish. I shall put aside everything and have my
time free for you."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weil nodded.</p>

<p>"Let it be Thursday then. And the hour&mdash;shall
we call it eight?"</p>

<p>The time was promptly agreed to.</p>

<p>"In the meantime, I will take the MSS. and look
it over, to form a general idea of the plot. Here is
my card. By-the-way, you will of course arrange it
so that we shall not be interrupted during our conference.
It disturbs anything of that kind to have
people coming in and out. We want to be entirely
alone so as to give our full attention to the work in
hand."</p>

<p>Miss Fern smilingly acquiesced, saying that it was
exactly what she would wish.</p>

<p>"And do you think there may be hope for it yet&mdash;that
poor little manuscript?" she asked, as she stood
by the door ready to take her departure.</p>

<p>"That is a question I can hardly answer," he replied.
"I shall be better able to tell you in a week
or two, I trust."</p>

<p>She lingered, with her hand on the door knob.</p>

<p>"My father is willing to take all the financial
risks," she said. "That ought to make a difference,
don't you think so?"</p>

<p>"It would, with many houses," he admitted. "I
am glad to know these things. Thursday, then,
Miss&mdash;Miss Fern."</p>

<p>He wanted to call her "Millicent," for he had
read the name on the package he still held in his
hand; but on the whole he concluded that this would
be a little premature.</p>

<h3>"HER FEET WERE PINK."</h3>


<p>When Miss Millicent Fern entered the office of
Lawrence Gouger, as detailed in the preceding
chapter, it will be remembered that she found that
gentleman and his friend, Archie Weil, with their
hats in their hands. The fact was that Mr. Weil had
but just entered the room, and that Mr. Gouger
had accepted an invitation to take lunch with him,
an arrangement that was by no means an infrequent
one between them. The entrance of Miss Fern, and
the subsequent proceedings, compelled the literary
critic to go out alone, as has been seen. When he
returned he found Mr. Weil still there.</p>

<p>"Haven't you been to lunch yet!" exclaimed Mr.
Gouger.</p>

<p>"I have not been out of this office," was the reply,
"and all appetite for anything to eat has left me.
Lawrence, that is one of the most interesting girls I
ever met."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger pursed up his lips, and uttered an
impatient, "Pah!" He then remarked that Mr.
Weil had a habit of finding such a quality in the
latest women of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>"What does she amount to?" he asked. "An
overgrown schoolgirl, who did not half learn her
lessons. Read that MSS. she left here, and get
disillusionized in short order. Why, she doesn't
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>even know how to spell, and her periods and commas
are in a hopeless tangle."</p>

<p>His companion eyed him quizzically.</p>

<p>"Are periods and commas, even a correct spelling
of the English language, the only things you can see
in a bright, handsome girl?" he demanded. "For
shame, Lawrence! You are a dried-up old mummy.
Your senses are numb. A lively wind will come in
at the keyhole some day and blow you out of that
chimney."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger heaved a sigh, as if to say that discussion
with such a nonsensical fellow was useless,
and took his seat at his desk, where an unfinished
pile of MSS. awaited his reading.</p>

<p>"She's given me leave to take her story home,"
said Mr. Weil, with a mischievous expression.</p>

<p>The critic stared at his friend.</p>

<p>"Given it to you?" he repeated. "How did that
happen?"</p>

<p>"I asked her for it, naturally. You were so
severe on the poor child, that I couldn't help putting
in a cheering word. We talked of the whole business,
and she was willing I should see if my opinion
agreed with yours."</p>

<p>"<i>Your</i> opinion!" echoed Gouger, testily. "What
is that worth? But take the stuff, if you want it,
and when you are done, send it to her; it will make
less rubbish in this confounded hole. One thing I'll
tell you, though, in advance. You'll never be able
to make sense of it, unless you get some one to
straighten it out."</p>

<p>"That's all right," replied the other. "After I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>have read it through, I am going to Miss Fern's
house, where she will read it to me."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger started from his chair.</p>

<p>"You don't mean that!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"But I do. She asked me, and I'm going. I
understand that it's a rather bold tale, and I can
conceive nothing more entertaining than to hear
that kind of thing from the red lips of such a pretty
piece of flesh and blood as has just left here."</p>

<p>There was an uneasy expression on the face of the
critic as he heard these words. He liked Weil,
although they were as different in their natures as
two men could well be. He wanted to please him,
but the aspect of this affair was not agreeable.</p>

<p>"Look here, Archie," he said, earnestly, "there
are some things that I can't permit, you know. My
office must not be made a starting-place for one of
your lawless adventures. You met Miss Fern here.
Now, I protest against your going to her house,
pretending that you are interested in that novel,
when your real purpose is of a much more questionable
kind."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil put on the air of one whose feelings are
lacerated by an unjust suspicion.</p>

<p>"My dear Lawrence&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"That's all right," growled the critic. "I may or
may not be your 'dear Lawrence,' but I know you
like&mdash;like a book," he added, hitting by accident on
a very excusable simile. "You are an old dog that
is not likely to learn new tricks. I shall send this
MSS. back to Miss Fern, myself, enclosing a letter
warning her to have nothing to do with you."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span></p>

<p>A laugh escaped the lips of Archie Weil at this
proposition.</p>

<p>"If you knew the feminine mind half as well as
you do modern literature," he answered, "you would
see how little that would avail. I have met Miss
Fern and made a distinctly favorable impression.
Her address is in my pocket, and I have received a
pressing invitation to call. If you choose to send
the MSS. by another messenger you will relieve me
of the task of carrying a bundle, but you will accomplish
nothing more."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger's mouth opened in astonishment at
the evident advantage which his friend had gained
in so short a time.</p>

<p>"You must have convinced her that your literary
opinions are of value," he said, presently. "If I
write that you are a charletan and entirely unworthy
of attention, what will happen then?"</p>

<p>The smiling gentleman opposite crossed his hands
over his left knee, and did not delay his answer.</p>

<p>"I will tell you," he said. "In the same mail she
will receive a letter from me, warning her that a certain
party, who has given an adverse judgment on her
writings, may attempt to influence her against others
more likely to decide in her favor. She will be told
that, having rejected a book, this certain party does
not wish any one else to print it. Send the severest
note you can construct, Lawrence. I have few
talents, but I know how to write letters."</p>

<p>The critic could hardly believe that fate had
thrown so many cords around his neck in the brief
space of one hour, but the more he thought the more
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>he became convinced that his best course was to shut
his eyes.</p>

<p>"Well, gang your gait," he said, after a long
pause, during which the look of triumph deepened
on his companion's face. "You will have to answer
for your own sins. But I'll tell you one thing, that
may save your time. Women who write racy novels
are almost without exception remarkably correct in
their own lives."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil inquired if his friend was certain of this,
and there was a suspicion of disappointment in his
tone.</p>

<p>"Absolutely," said Mr. Gouger, refreshing his
memory. "I can think of a dozen instances to prove
the point. There is Lelia Dant&eacute;, for instance, who
writes like a&mdash;like a&mdash;well, you know how she writes.
She sticks to her mother's apron strings like a four-year-old
child. They never are seen apart, I am
told. Then there is Mrs. Helen Walker Wilbur, the
poetess. We have a volume of her verse that is positively
combustible from its own heat. The sheets
had to be run off the press soaked in water to keep
them from igniting. The room was full of steam all
the time the work was going on. Warm! I should
say so! Now, that woman is vain, and she dresses
foolishly, and she does odd things for the sake of
being talked about&mdash;but nobody questions her loyalty
to her husband. You would think by some of
her poems that an East Indian regiment would not
suffice for her, and yet she is the straightest wife on
Manhattan Island. Oh, I know so many cases. You
remember that girl who wrote, 'Love's Extremities,'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
a work as passionate as Sappho. She is a little
Quaker-like maiden,<a name="FNanchor_A_1" id="FNanchor_A_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> who dresses and talks like a
sister of one of the Episcopal guilds. These women
are on fire at the brain only. They would repel a
physical advance with more indignation than those
endowed with less esthetic perceptions. So, see Miss
Fern as much as you like. Should you attempt anything
improper you will prove the truth of my assertions."</p>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_A_1" id="Footnote_A_1"></a>[Note <a href="#FNanchor_A_1">A</a>: Now dead, alas!&mdash;A. R.]</p></div>

<p>Mr. Weil changed the knee he had been nursing,
but the quiet smile did not leave his countenance.</p>

<p>"What an inconsistent fellow you are, Lawrence,"
he said. "I could convict you of a hundred errors
of logic. Do you remember telling Mr. Roseleaf
that a man should have a passion before he attempts
to depict one."</p>

<p>"And I say so still," retorted Gouger. "<i>You</i>
don't call the ravings of these poetesses and female
novelists real life, do you? <i>You</i> know the actual
lover isn't content with kissing the hair and the feet
of his divinity! There is more about women's <i>feet</i>
in these poems and novels than all the rest of their
anatomy put together. And what is a woman's foot?
Did you ever see one that was pretty&mdash;that you
wanted to put to your lips?"</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Archie, dreamily, "once. At
Capri. She was fifteen. Her feet were pink, like a
shell. She was walking along the shore in the early
evening."</p>

<p>"With the dirt of the soil on them!" exclaimed Mr.
Gouger, in disgust.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, she had just emerged from her bath. The
sand there was clean as a carpet, cleaner, in fact.
Gods! They were exquisite!"</p>

<p>The critic uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"I waste time talking to you," he said, sharply.
"You are like the rest of the imaginative crowd. It
is a pity you were not gifted with the divine afflatus,
that you could have added your volumes to the nonsense
they print."</p>

<p>"And which you are always glad to get," interpolated
Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>"Because it will sell. Cutt &amp; Slashem are in this
business to make money, and my thoughts must be
directed to the saleable quality of the manuscripts
submitted. If <i>I</i> was running the concern, though, I
<a name="Page_41t" id="Page_41t"></a><a href="#Page_41tn">would</a> touch the mooney, maundering mess. It makes
my flesh creep, sometimes, to read it."</p>

<p>Archie Weil uttered another of his winsome laughs.</p>

<p>"How would you like to be a serpent," he asked,
"and have your flesh creep all the time? But before
we dismiss this matter of Miss Fern, I want you
to clear your mind, if you can, of the haunting suspicions
you always have when a woman is concerned.
You know there are concerns in the city who
would print her book, with a proper amount paid
down, if it had neither sense, syntax nor orthography.
If she wants it fixed up, I can find tailors to help her
out; and if her papa wants it on the market, why
shouldn't he be able to get it there? Now, let us
talk a little about Roseleaf."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger brightened at the change of subject.
His interest in Mr. Roseleaf was genuine, and he had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>already learned that Archie had formed a sort of
copartnership with the novelist, in the hope of making
his future work a success. While the critic could
not be said to have any real faith in the arrangement,
it certainly interested him.</p>

<p>"What strange freak will you take to next?" he
asked. "And do you really expect to make a novelist
out of that young man?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil's eyes had a twinkle in them.</p>

<p>"Didn't you say, yourself, that it could be done?"
he inquired. "If I have made any mistake in my
investment, I shall charge the loss to you."</p>

<p>The critic reflected a minute.</p>

<p>"I'm not so certain it <i>can't</i> be done," he said.
"But that's quite different from investing money in
it, as you are doing. A man wants pretty near a certainty
before he puts up the stuff."</p>

<p>"You greedy fellow!" exclaimed Weil. "Will you
never think of anything but gain? I have to spend
about so much money every year, in a continual
attempt to amuse myself, and it might as well be
this way as another. I have a document, signed and
solemnly sealed, by which I am to back him against
the field in the interest of romantic and realistic
literature, and in return he is to give me a third of
the net profits of his writings. I don't know that I
have done so badly. Perhaps you may live to see
Cutt &amp; Slashem pay us a handsome sum in royalties."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger looked oddly at his friend, whose face
was perfectly serious.</p>

<p>"What are you going to begin with?" he asked.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>

<p>"Love, of course. It is the A&nbsp;B&nbsp;C, as well as the
X&nbsp;Y&nbsp;Z of the whole business."</p>

<p>"What kind of love?"</p>

<p>"The best that can be got," replied Weil, now
laughing in spite of himself. "The very finest quality
in the market. Oh, we shall do this up brown, I
tell you."</p>

<p>"What have you done so far?" asked Gouger.</p>

<p>"You want to know it all, eh?" responded Mr.
Weil. "I don't think I am justified in letting you
too deeply into our secrets. However, you are too
honorable to betray us, and so here goes: I have
instructed my proteg&eacute; that he must fall violently
under the tender passion before next Saturday
night."</p>

<p>"With a lady whom you have selected, of course?"</p>

<p>"By no means. He must catch his own sweethearts."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger played with his watchchain.</p>

<p>"And this is Tuesday," he commented. "Do you
think he will succeed?"</p>

<p>"He must," laughed Weil. "It's like the case of
the boy who was digging out the woodchuck. 'The
minister's coming to dinner.'"</p>

<p>"You might at least have got an introduction for
him," said Gouger, reflectively.</p>

<p>"Not I. There's nothing in our agreement that
puts such a task on me. Besides, there's no romance
in an introduction. He would write a story as prosy
as one of Henry James' if he started off like that."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger nodded his head slowly.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"That would be something to avoid at all hazards,"
he assented.</p>

<p>And at this juncture, to the surprise of both the
parties to this conversation, the young man of whom
they were speaking entered the room.</p>

<p>"I was telling Mr. Gouger of our agreement," said
Mr. Weil, as soon as the greetings were over. "How
do you get along? Have you discovered your
heroine yet?"</p>

<p>Mr. Roseleaf answered, with an air of timidity, in
the negative.</p>

<p>"I don't quite know where to find one," he said.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil spread out his arms to their fullest
capacity.</p>

<p>"There are thirty millions of them in the United
States alone," he exclaimed. "Out of that number
you ought to find a few whom you can study. What
a pity that <i>I</i> cannot write! I would go out of that
door and in ten minutes I would have a subject ready
for vivisection."</p>

<p>The younger man raised his eyebrows slightly.</p>

<p>"But, that kind of a woman&mdash;would be what you
would want&mdash;the kind that would let you talk to her
on a mere street acquaintance!"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil leaned back in his chair and stretched
his legs.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes," he said. "She would do for a beginning.
Don't imagine that none of these easy going
girls are worth the attention of a novelist. Sometimes
they are vastly more interesting than the
bread and butter product of the drawing rooms. It
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>won't do, in your profession, to ignore any sort of
human being."</p>

<p>Roseleaf breathed a sigh as soft as his name.</p>

<p>"You were right, Mr. Gouger," he said, turning
to that gentleman. "I do not know anything. I
have judged by appearances, and I now see that
truth cannot be learned in that way."</p>

<p>"All the better!" broke in Archie. "The surest
progress is made by the man who has learned his
deficiencies. You remember the hare and the tortoise.
I have read somewhere that the race is not
always to the swift. You must treat your fellow
men and women as if you had just arrived on this
earth from the planet Mars. You must dig through
the strata of conventionality to the virgin soil
beneath. The great human passions are lust and
avarice, though they take a thousand forms, in many
of which they have more polite names. For instance,
the former, when kept within polite boundaries, is
usually known as Love. As Avarice makes but a sorry
theme for the romantic writer, Love is the subject
that must principally claim your attention. All the
world loves a lover, while the miser is despised even
by those who cringe beneath the power of his gold.
Study the women, my lad, and when you know them
thoroughly begin your great novel in earnest."</p>

<p>Roseleaf listened with rapt attention.</p>

<p>"And the men?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The men," was the quick reply, "are too transparent
to require study. It is the women, with their
ten million tricks to cajole and wheedle us, that
afford the best field for your efforts."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Gouger, who had never been known to take
so much time from his work during business hours,
tried to begin his reading, but without success.
When at his usual occupation he would not have
been disturbed by the conversation of a room full of
people, so preoccupied was he with what he had to
do; but on this occasion he was too much entertained
with his companions to do anything but hear
them through.</p>

<p>"Is there no such thing as unselfish love&mdash;in a
woman&mdash;love that sacrifices itself for its object?"
asked Roseleaf, with a trace of anxiety in his tone.</p>

<p>"M&mdash;&mdash;m, possibly," drawled Mr. Weil. "A female
animal with young sometimes evinces the possession
of that sort of thing, and women may have touches
of it on occasions. That will be a good point for
you to remember when you are deeper in your investigations.
However, I ought not to fill your head
with ideas of my own. I think what we most desire
in our friend," he added, turning to the critic, "is
complete originality."</p>

<p>The young man shifted his feet nervously.</p>

<p>"Pardon me," he said, "would it not be well to
talk with people and learn their impressions? Then
I can compare these with my own experiences, when
they come. You would not send a blind man out on
the street unled."</p>

<p>Archie Weil laughed deliciously.</p>

<p>"You are ingenious, when you should only be
ingenuous," he replied. "You do not act at all like
the young man from Mars that I have in mind. Perhaps,
nevertheless, you are not wholly wrong, for even
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>my traveler from that planet might have to ask his
way to the nearest town. Supposing you had just
reached the earth, and had met me with a thousand
questions. What could I answer that would be of
any use?"</p>

<p>Mr. Roseleaf reflected a moment.</p>

<p>"You could tell me your idea of a perfect woman,"
he suggested.</p>

<p>"Well, I will," said Weil, glancing meaningly at
Mr. Gouger. "The perfect woman is about nineteen
years of age. She is neither very light nor very
dark. Her eyes are hazel, with a touch of gray in
them. She measures, say, five feet, four inches in
height, and&mdash;about&mdash;twenty-two inches around the
waist. She has a plump arm, not too fleshy, a well-made
leg, a head set on her shoulders with enough
neck to give it freedom and grace of movement,
but not sufficient to warrant comparison with a
swan, or even a goose. Her hands match her feet,
being not too slender nor too dainty. Her hips are
medium, but not bulging. She weighs in the vicinity
of a hundred and twenty-five pounds. And her
hair&mdash;there is but one color for a woman's hair&mdash;is
Titian red."</p>

<p>The young man had taken out his note-book and
rapidly sketched this list of attractions.</p>

<p>"Every woman cannot have Titian hair," remarked
Mr. Gouger. "Would you condemn one
with all the other attributes on account of missing
that?"</p>

<p>"I would, decidedly," was the reply, "when it is
obtained so easily. I think it only costs two dollars
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>a bottle, for the finest shade. Have you written it
all down, Mr. Roseleaf?"</p>

<p>The young man ran over his notes.</p>

<p>"I have it&mdash;all but the hair," he said. "Of course
I could not forget that."</p>

<p>"Very well. And this hair must be long enough,
but not too long, remember, for everything unduly
accentuated spoils a woman. It should hang about
five inches below the waist, when unfastened, and be
thick enough to make a noticeable coil. There
should be sufficient to hide her face and her lover's
when he takes her in his arms."</p>

<p>Mr. Roseleaf started slightly.</p>

<p>"Then she should have a lover?" he remarked,
curiously.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly. Else why the hair and the arms,
and the five feet four! It is a woman's business to
be loved and to make herself lovable. When you
have found this woman, if she has no lover, you will
be expected to officiate in that capacity. If she has
one, you must supplant him as soon as possible.
And when you have fallen desperately, ravingly in
love with such a creature, you will not have to come
to me for further advice."</p>

<p>The young man surveyed the speaker with the
utmost gravity.</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> ever been in love?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"Never."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"It was not necessary; <i>I</i> did not intend to write
novels," said Archie, with a laugh. "But, come, we
have bothered Lawrence enough. Let us go."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>

<p>He took the package containing Miss Fern's story,
and sauntered out, paying no attention to the peculiar
glances that his friend, the critic, threw at him
as he was leaving.</p>

<h3>WITH TITIAN TRESSES.</h3>


<p>Mr. Weil deciphered the MSS. of Miss Fern with
some difficulty. Not that the handwriting was particularly
illegible, though it did not in the least
resemble copperplate engraving; but, as Mr. Gouger
had intimated, the sentences were so badly constructed,
and the punctuation so different from that
prescribed by the usual authorities, that he was continually
obliged to go back over his tracks and hunt
for meanings. Nevertheless, within an hour from
the time when he sat down in his room at the Hoffman
House and opened the package he had
brought, he had to confess himself deeply interested.</p>

<p>Miss Fern had conceived some entertaining characters,
and some very unconventional situations.
Her people were virile; her hero was strong if not
always grammatical; her heroine did and said things
not common in real life, and yet that were quite
reasonable when her peculiar nature and environment
were considered.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie paused once in awhile to wonder how
much of all this record was within the direct knowledge
of the young authoress; which expressions conveyed
her own ideas and which sentiments she
would personally endorse. Gouger might be right
as to the exceeding purity of most of the ladies who
dealt in eroticism, but in this especial case Mr. Weil
meant to make an investigation on his own account
before he accepted as a universal rule the one his
friend had laid down.</p>

<p>He did not go to sleep that night until he had
finished his story. Had it been arranged by a
competent hand he could have read it in four hours,
but as it was he consumed eight in the work. With
all its faults, he liked it. There was something
breezy about it, and it had a theme that he did
not remember had been treated exactly in the same
way before. Though, as he himself had said, without
much talent for composition, Archie had read a
great many books. It is no proof because a person
cannot write that he would make a poor critic. Mr.
Weil might almost have filled Lawrence Gouger's
place at Cutt &amp; Slashem's. He had written fugitive
pieces in his time for the papers, in reference to his
travels, which had been extensive, and had even contributed
occasional book reviews to the magazines.
His connection with Gouger enabled him to keep in
touch with what was going on in the literary world,
and the dozens of new volumes which passed
through that office were always at his disposal.</p>

<p>"She's not a fool, by any means," he remarked to
himself, when he put down the last sheet of Miss<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Fern's work. "A fellow who understood his business
might put that into such shape that it would be
worth using. I mean to find some one who can do
it, and suggest the idea to her, when I get to that
stage in this affair. Let me see, who do I know that
could undertake it?"</p>

<p>He had begun to undress, and was in the act of
taking off his collar as he spoke. His mind ran
over a list of struggling literary men. Something
seemed the matter with most of them. There was
Hamlin, but he would be too exacting, and would
want to suggest alterations in the story itself, which
would never do. There was Insley, whose last three
books had been flat failures, and for whom Cutt &amp;
Slashem had positively refused to print anything
more; but Insley had gone into the country for the
summer and nobody knew his address. Then there
was&mdash;</p>

<p>"<i>Roseleaf!</i>"</p>

<p>Archie received this thought like an inspiration.
He threw his cravat on the bureau and began tugging
at his shoestrings to the imminent danger of
getting them into hard knots that no one could
unravel. Roseleaf! Why not? The boy would do
almost anything he suggested, so great was his confidence
that a road to literary preferment could be
staked out over that path. Roseleaf would not
undertake the work for the sake of pecuniary compensation,
but the thing could be presented to him
in quite another light. In Miss Fern's story there
were living, breathing men and women. In his
own there were beautifully drawn marionettes. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>could be made to see that the study of the young
lady's method was worth his while. And then!</p>

<p>Mr. Weil's shoes lay on the floor, in the disorder of
a bachelor who had never in his life taken pains to
put anything in the place where it really belonged.
He took out the studs of his shirt, pulled that garment
over his head, and then sat for some minutes
wrapped in active thought.</p>

<p>"They must be introduced to each other!" he
exclaimed, at last. "Between them they have every
qualification for success; apart they are like the
separated wheels of a watch. There is Shirley, with
a style so sweetly subtle, a grace so perfect, every
line a gem; and with it all not a sign of human
emotion. There is Millicent, full of plot and daring
and breathing characters, and bold conceptions, and
no more able to write good English than an Esquimaux
squaw. I have both these interesting persons
on my hands, and I must combine them, for their
mutual good.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Gouger will say when I unfold my
plan. Perhaps I had best not tell him. He actually
came near threatening, to-day, to send a line to Miss
Fern, warning her against me. He wouldn't have
done it, though. Lawrence has a bark that is worse
than his bite by a great deal. Yes, I'll bring these
young folks together. I'll take them as Hermann does
the rabbits, and press them gently but firmly into
one. And then sha'n't we get a combination! And
won't Mr. Lawrence Gouger hug himself when the
product of their joint endeavor comes to him for a
reading!"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>The muser finished disrobing and donned his night
robes, but it was a long time before he felt like
slumber. He could think of nothing but his scheme.
As he revolved it over in his mind, it took many new
forms. At first Roseleaf was to be asked to rewrite
the story that Miss Fern had offered Cutt &amp; Slashem.
And afterwards there must be an entirely new novel,
conceived together and worked out slowly, using the
best of what was brightest in both of them.</p>

<p>The last idea Mr. Weil had before he relapsed into
unconsciousness contained two novels, worked out
at the same time. Roseleaf was all right, if he could
only get a glimpse of realism into his work. Miss
Fern would have no trouble if her ideas could find a
garb that suited them.</p>

<p>There would be a way to make them of service to
each other, and the time to cross a bridge is always
when you come to it. So thought Archie Weil, as he
fell asleep.</p>

<p>In the morning he laughed to think of the description
he had given to Shirley, in his offhand way,
of "the perfect woman." It was a faithful list of
Miss Millicent's charms, so far as they were apparent
to him. Shirley had noted them down with great
carefulness, and would be sure to notice how fully
the authoress met the ideal he now had in mind. It
only remained for the schemer to say something to
Miss Fern that would suggest Roseleaf to her, whenever
they were made acquainted.</p>

<p>It must be plain to the reader that Mr. Weil's principal
intention in this whole matter was to dispose
of the <i>ennui</i> which idleness brings even to its most
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>adoring devotees. He had a fair fortune, accumulated
by a father who had denied himself every luxury
to amass it. Drifting to New York, he had
found the vicinity of the Hoffman House very agreeable,
and his companions, with the exception of Mr.
Gouger, were of about as light views of life as himself.
The critic was one of those strange exceptions
with which most of us come in contact, where persons
of entirely opposite tastes and inclinations
become attached friends.</p>

<p>Breakfast was served so late to Mr. Weil that he
had not finished that repast when the young novelist
made his appearance. Seating himself on the side
of the table that faced his friend, Mr. Roseleaf
responded to the latter's inquiries in regard to his
health by saying that he was quite well. Indeed, he
looked it. His eye was bright, his cheek rosy. His
attire showed just enough of a negligent quality to
be attractive. There was an air about him such as
is often associated with an artist of the pencil and
brush.</p>

<p>"Never better in health," he said, "but very anxious
to begin something definite in the way of
work."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil smiled his most affable smile.</p>

<p>"What did I tell you to do, first?" he asked, playfully.</p>

<p>"To fall in love."</p>

<p>"Which you have not yet done!"</p>

<p>The young man shook his head.</p>

<p>"Good Heavens! And you have lost more than a
week!"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Roseleaf colored more than ever.</p>

<p>"Isn't there something else&mdash;that I could&mdash;begin
on?" he asked, humbly.</p>

<p>"I don't know of anything. Love is the alphabet
of the novelist. You'd best go straight. Aren't
there any eligible young women at your lodging
house?"</p>

<p>The younger man thought a moment.</p>

<p>"No; only the chambermaid."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil sipped his coffee with a wise expression.</p>

<p>"It may come to that," he said, putting down the
cup, "but we'll hope not. We will hope not. What's
the matter with Central Park? There are five hundred
nice girls there every afternoon."</p>

<p>"But I don't know them," said Roseleaf, desperately.
"And&mdash;I have been there. Yesterday
one of them looked at me and smiled. I walked
toward her, and she slackened her speed. When I
came within a few feet she almost stopped. Then&mdash;I
could think of nothing to say to her, and I walked
on, looking in the other direction."</p>

<p>Several breakfasters in the vicinity turned their
heads to note the couple at the table, from which a
laugh that could be heard all over the room came
musically.</p>

<p>"Why didn't you say 'Good-morning?'"</p>

<p>"Yes! And she might have said 'Good-morning.'
And then it would be my turn, and what could I
have done?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil folded up his napkin and laid it by his
plate.</p>

<p>"You coward," he replied, affably, "you could
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>have done a thousand things. You could have
remarked that the day was fair, or that you wondered
if it would rain. And you could have asked
her to stroll over to a restaurant and take a little
refreshment. Once opposite to her, the rest would
have come fast enough."</p>

<p>The novelist took out a handkerchief and wiped
the perspiration from his forehead. It all seemed
very easy the way Archie described it, but he was
sure it would be very different in practice. How
could he know, he demanded, that the young lady
would go to the restaurant with him? She might
have declined, and then he would have been in a
worse position than ever.</p>

<p>"Declined!" echoed Archie. "Declined a lunch?
Declined ice cream? Declined champagne frapp&eacute;!
Well, you <i>are</i> ignorant of the sex. My dear boy, it
is evident that I shall have to introduce you to the
leading lady of your company, and if you will be
patient for a very few days, I hope to be able to
do so."</p>

<p>Rousing himself with a show of genuine interest,
Roseleaf inquired for further particulars.</p>

<p>"Listen," replied the other. "I expect, to-morrow
evening, to spend a few hours in the company of
one of the most charming members of her sex. She,
like you, has an ambition to become a successful
writer. Like you, also, she lacks some of the prime
qualities that are needed for that end. It happens,
however, that the things wanting are entirely different
in each of your cases&mdash;that you will, if you
choose, be able to supplement and perfect each other.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
I shall tell her that I know a young man of literary
taste who will give her advice on the points in which
she is deficient. With such an opening you will be
at once on Easy street, and if you cannot fall in love
within forty-eight hours, I shall regard you as a case
too hopeless to merit further attention at my hands."</p>

<p>The young man's cheek glowed with pleasure.</p>

<p>"That is more like it," he said. "When do you
think I shall be able to meet this young lady?"</p>

<p>"Within a week or two, at the latest. I must
sound her before I trust you with her, for she is
nearly as much a stranger to me, so far, as to you.
Of course there is no objection&mdash;quite the contrary&mdash;to
your falling in love elsewhere in the meantime, if
opportunity serves."</p>

<p>At this moment Mr. Weil called his companion's
attention to a rather corpulent gentleman who had
just entered the breakfast room and was stopping
near the door to hold a brief conversation with some
one he had met there.</p>

<p>"You see that fellow?" he remarked. "Wait a
minute, and I will get him over here. If you ever
want to put a real character into one of your stories
you will only need to take his photograph. In
actual life he is as dull as a rusty meat axe, but for
literary purposes he would be a godsend."</p>

<p>Catching the eye of the person of whom he was
speaking, Mr. Weil motioned to him to come to his
part of the room, and as he approached arranged a
chair for him invitingly.</p>

<p>"Mr. Boggs, I want to present a young friend of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>mine to you," said Archie, rising. "Mr. Walker
Boggs&mdash;Mr. Shirley Roseleaf."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs went through the usual ceremony,
announcing that he was most happy, etc., in the
perfunctory style that a million other men follow
every day. Then he took the chair that was offered
him, and gave an order for his breakfast to a waiter.</p>

<p>"Are you a New Yorker, Mr. Roseleaf?" he asked,
when this important matter was disposed of.</p>

<p>"Mr. Roseleaf is staying here for the present,"
explained Mr. Weil. "He is a novelist by profession,
and I tell him there is no better place to study
the sensational than this vicinity."</p>

<p>The young man's color deepened. He doubted if
it was right to introduce the subject in exactly these
terms. Mr. Boggs' next question did not detract
from his uneasiness.</p>

<p>"Excuse me&mdash;I am not altogether up in current
literature, and I must ask what Mr. Roseleaf has
written."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil helped his young friend out of this
dilemma as well as he could.</p>

<p>"He has written nothing, as yet; at least nothing
that has been printed," he said. "He is wise, I
think, in laying a deep foundation for his romances,
instead of rushing into print with the first thoughts
that enter his head, as so many do, to their own subsequent
regret and the distress of their readers. I
want him to meet men and women who have known
what life is by their own experiences. You ought
to be worth something to a bright writer, Walker.
You have had many an adventure in your day."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Walker Boggs shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"In my 'day,' yes," he assented. "Enough to fill
the Astor and Lenox libraries and leave enough for
Charlie Dillingham and The American News Company.
But that is nothing but history now. My
'day' is over and it will never return."</p>

<p>He paused and ran his right hand dejectedly
across his vest in the vicinity of the waist band.
Though he knew perfectly what Mr. Boggs referred
to, Archie Weil wanted him to express it in his own
words to Shirley.</p>

<p>"You wouldn't think," continued Mr. Boggs, after
a pause which seemed filled with strange emotions,
"that my figure was once the admiration of every
lady who saw it, that they used to stop and gaze at
me with eyes of positive envy. And now&mdash;look
at this!"</p>

<p>He indicated his embonpoint again, and shook his
head wrathfully.</p>

<p>"It is simply damnable," he continued, as neither
of the others thought best to interrupt him. "When
I was twenty-four I had a reputation that was as
wide as the continent. When I walked down Broadway
you would have supposed a procession was
passing, the crowds gathered in such numbers. If it
was mentioned that I would spend a week at Saratoga
or Newport, the hotels had not a room to spare
while I remained. The next year I married, and as
one of the fashion journals put it, two thousand
women went into mourning. For a decade I devoted
myself entirely to my wife and to business. I
made some money, and kept out of the public eye.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Then my wife died, and I retired from the firm with
which I had been connected. The next twelve
months dragged terribly. I did not know what to
do. Finally I decided that there was but one course
open to me. I must resume again the position I had
vacated as a leader of fashion."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil bowed, as if to say that this was a very
natural and praiseworthy conclusion; precisely as if
he had not heard the story told in substantially the
same way a dozen times before. He was watching
Roseleaf's interested expression and had difficulty
in repressing an inclination to laugh aloud.</p>

<p>"I sought out the best tailor in the city," continued
Mr. Boggs. "I went to the most fashionable
hair dresser. I spent considerable time in selecting
hats, cravats and gloves. When all was ready I
took a stroll, as I had done in the old days, from
Fiftieth street, down Fifth Avenue and Broadway to
Union Square. I met a few acquaintances who
stared at me slightly, but did not act in the least
impressed. The women merely glanced up and
glanced away again. What was the matter? I
went home and took a long survey of myself in the
mirror, a cheval glass that showed me from crown
to toe. My costume was perfect. There was not a
wrinkle in my face&mdash;this was several years ago, remember.
There was not a gray hair in my head
then&mdash;there are a few now, I admit. 'What is it?'
I asked myself a hundred times as I stood there,
studying out the cursed problem. My tie was all
right, my shirt front of the latest cut, my watch chain
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>straight from Tiffany's, my&mdash;ah! I saw it all in a
moment!"</p>

<p>Roseleaf, who did not see it even yet, wore such an
astonished expression that Mr. Weil had to stuff his
napkin into his mouth to prevent an explosion.</p>

<p>"It was this devilish abdomen!" said Mr. Boggs,
slapping that portion of his frame as if he had a special
grudge against it and would be glad if he could
hit it hard enough to bring it to a realizing sense of
its turpitude. "My figure had gone to the devil! It
was not as large as it is now, but it was large enough
to cook my gruel. My waist had increased so gradually
that I had never noticed it. I got a tape and
took its measure. Forty-two inches, sir! The jig
was up. With a heart as young as ever, with a face
as good and a purse able to supply all reasonable
demands, I was knocked out of the race on the first
round by this adipose tissue that no ingenuity could
hope to conceal!"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil could wait no longer. His musical laugh
rang out over the room.</p>

<p>"Let this be a warning to you, Shirley," he said,
"to wear corsets."</p>

<p>"It is no joke," was the indignant comment of Mr.
Walker Boggs, as he proceeded to add to his rotundity
by devouring the hearty breakfast that the waiter
had just brought him. "I am left like a marooned
sailor on the sea of life. The only occupation that
could have entertained me is gone. It is no time to
enter business again, I couldn't have selected a wiser
one to leave it. I don't want to marry, once was
enough of that. The only women I can attract are
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>those commercially inclined females that any other
man could have as well as I. What is the result?
My life is ruined. I take no pleasure in anything.
I eat, walk about, go to a play, sleep. A <i>pig</i> could
do as much; and a pig would not have these memories
to haunt him, these recollections of a time so
different that I am almost driven wild."</p>

<p>Roseleaf felt a sincere pity for the unfortunate
gentleman, and did not see the slightest element of
humor in his melancholy recital. But Archie Weil
could not be restrained.</p>

<p>"You're right about that pig business," he remarked.
"You recall the incident in Mother Goose,
where&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">'A little pig found a fifty dollar note,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And purchased a hat and a very fine coat.'<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"There are strange parallels in history."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs would have replied to this remark in the
terms it deserved had he not been too much engaged
at the moment in masticating a particularly fine
chop. As it was he growled over the meat like a
mastiff in bad humor.</p>

<p>"Are there no remedies for excessive accumulation
of fat in the abdominal region?" asked Weil,
taking his advantage. "It seems to me I have read
advertisements of them in the newspapers."</p>

<p>"Remedies!" retorted the other, having swallowed
the food and supplemented it with a glass of ale.
"There are a thousand, and I have tried them all. I
have taken things by the gross. I have paid money
to every quack I could find. For awhile I starved
myself so nearly to death that I went to making my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>will. And every day I grew stouter. I don't know
what I measure now, and I don't care. A few
fathoms more or less, doesn't count, when one falls
from a steamer in midocean."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil took occasion to say that there was no
need for this extreme discouragement. A little coin
in the hand, or a new diamond ring, would still bring
youth and beauty to his disconsolate friend.</p>

<p>"That's just it," retorted Boggs. "It's the contrast
that's killing me. The only women who would
look at me to-day are mercenary ones that wouldn't
care if I was black as Othello or big as George IV.
Why, I could show you a trunkful of letters, written
me by the finest women in this country, when I was
at my best. They breathe but one thing&mdash;love, love,
love! I lived on it! It was the air that kept my
lungs in motion. And I thought to go back to it so
easily! <i>Ah!</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs commenced upon his fourth chop and
emptied the last of the quart bottle into his glass.</p>

<p>"Well, I'm sorry for you," said Weil. "I think
the times must have changed, as well as yourself,
though. Now, here's a young fellow, with all the
qualifications of face, figure and address that you
once had, and he claims to be unable to make the
acquaintance of a single interesting woman between
Brooklyn Bridge and Spuyten Duyvil."</p>

<p>The heavy eyes of Mr. Walker Boggs rested upon
the youthful face opposite to him. Under the scrutiny
to which he was subjected Roseleaf reddened, in
the way he had. He had never looked more handsome.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>"This is evidently a jest of yours," said Boggs,
turning to Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>"Not in the least, I assure you."</p>

<p>"Then I say he can do what he likes, and I know
it," replied the stout man. "If I had his form I'd
have to ask the police to clear the way for me. I
have seen circulation impeded in front of this very
hotel because I was coming out to take my carriage.
If he won't look at them, why, of course, the women
can't do it all, but it lies with him."</p>

<p>Roseleaf's eyes glistened with a strange mixture
of hope and fear. He did not think he would care
to be in such great demand as that, but he dearly
wished to break through the iron bars that enclosed
him. He glanced in a glass that paneled the wall
near by. He was good-looking enough, it was no
vanity to say so. What he lacked was confidence.</p>

<p>"He is afraid of them, that's his trouble," smiled
Weil. "We will cure him of that, and when he gets
to know women as they are he will give us a novel
that will set all creation by the ears. Gouger&mdash;you
know Gouger&mdash;says he writes the purest English.
All he needs is a taste of life."</p>

<p>To this Mr. Boggs gave his unqualified assent.
And he added that if he could be of any service in
the matter he would only be too glad.</p>

<p>"We thank you for the offer, and may be able
later to make use of it," said Mr. Weil. "And now
good-morning, for we have important business to
attend to."</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked long and earnestly at the person
they were leaving. He seemed to him a very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>ordinary individual. If such a man had won the
love of scores of beautiful women, surely he himself
could gain the affections of one. When he stood
with Weil in front of the hotel, by which an unrivaled
procession of ladies and gentleman was
already beginning to pass, though it was only eleven
o'clock, he felt much encouraged.</p>

<p>"They are looking at you," whispered Archie,
"plenty of them. Did you see those two girls in
pink in that landau? Why, they nearly broke their
necks to get the last glimpse of you. There is
another lady who would stop if you asked her, pretty
as any of them, though she must be nearly thirty.
Your eyes are not open. Ah, here is something
better! In that carriage, with the Titian tresses!"</p>

<p>It was Miss Millicent Fern, and she bowed to Mr.
Weil. Then her bright eyes lit up with a new lustre
as they fell upon his companion.</p>

<h3>STUDYING MISS MILLICENT.</h3>


<p>When Mr. Weil made his appearance at the residence
of Mr. Wilton Fern, the door was opened for him
by a young negro of such superb proportions that the
caller could not help observing him with admiration.
He thought he had never seen a man more perfectly
formed. The face, though too dark to suggest
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>the least admixture of Caucasian blood, was well
featured. The lips were not thick nor was the nose
flat, as is the case with so many of the African race.
The voice, as the visitor heard it, was by no means
unpleasant. Mr. Weil could not imagine a better
model for an ebony statue than this butler, or footman,
or whatever position, perhaps both, he might
be engaged to fill.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir, Miss Millicent is in, and she is expecting
you," said the negro, in his pleasant and strong
tones. "Let me take your hat and stick. Now, sir,
this way."</p>

<p>Miss Fern came in a few moments to the parlor,
where Archie was left, and greeted him most cordially.</p>

<p>"There is a sitting-room on the next floor," she
said, "where we shall not be disturbed. I have
given Hannibal orders to admit no one, saying that
we shall want the evening entirely to ourselves."</p>

<p>"Hannibal?" repeated the visitor. "Is that the
name of the remarkable individual who received me
just now?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Miss Fern, rather coldly. "Though I
do not know why you call him 'remarkable.'"</p>

<p>"He is so tall, so grand, so entirely overpowering,"
explained Mr. Weil. "One would think he
might be the son of an African king. I never
saw a black man that gave me such an impression of
force and power."</p>

<p>Millicent elevated her eyebrows a little, as if
annoyed at these expressions. She answered, still
frigidly, that she had noticed nothing unusual about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
Hannibal. She did not believe she had looked
closely enough at his face to be able to identify him
in a court.</p>

<p>"He would make a fine character for a novel,"
said Mr. Weil, as they walked together up the broad
staircase. "I could almost write one myself, around
such a personality."</p>

<p>The young lady looked disgusted.</p>

<p>"A negro servant!" she exclaimed. "What kind
of a novel could you write with such a central
figure?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps I should not put him in the centre,"
laughed Archie, determined to win her good nature.
"Every story needs lights and shades. You can't
deny that he would cast a magnificent shadow."</p>

<p>The humor of this observation struck Miss Fern
and she joined mildly in her companion's mirth.
Then she remarked that the central figure of a novel&mdash;the
main thing in it&mdash;to her mind, should be a
being who could be given the attributes of beauty
and grace. The minor characters were of less
account, and would come into existence almost of
their own accord.</p>

<p>"And now, before we do anything more," she
said, "I want you to tell me about that excessively
handsome young man that I saw with you yesterday
in Madison Square."</p>

<p>Weil was delighted at this introduction of his
young friend. He began a most flattering account
of Shirley Roseleaf, describing him as a genuine
paragon among men, both in talent and goodness.
He drew heavily on his imagination as he proceeded,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>feeling that he was "in for it," and might as well do
his best at once. And he could see the cheek of the
young listener taking on a new and more enticing
color as he went farther and farther into his subject.</p>

<p>"If I have to rearrange my novel&mdash;the one Mr.
Gouger rejected&mdash;I shall draw my hero after that
model," she cried, when he paused for breath. "I
never saw a man who came so near my ideal."</p>

<p>"But&mdash;you would have to alter your hero's character,
in that case?" he said. "I have read your
MSS., and your description does not tally with my
young friend at all."</p>

<p>Miss Fern reddened.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to claim, do you," she replied,
"that physical beauty and moral goodness always
go hand in hand?"</p>

<p>"They should," he answered, in a tone that was
meant to be impressive.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is another question! <i>Do</i> they? that is
all the novelist needs to know. Did you ever read
Ouida's 'Sigma?' There are the two sisters, one as
pure as can be, the other quite the opposite, and the
beauty belongs to the depraved one. I know Oscar
Wilde takes a different view in 'Dorian Grey,' but
he is wrong. I am sure that the worst man or woman
in the world&mdash;reckoning by what are called the
'amiable vices'&mdash;might be the most lovely to look
upon, the most delightful to associate with. Eve
found the serpent attractive, remember."</p>

<p>Where did she learn all these things? Weil looked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>at her with increasing astonishment. "Amiable
vices." He liked the appellation.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you are right," he assented, as if slowly
convinced. "If you wish to be acquainted with
Mr. Roseleaf, I will bring him here with pleasure.
My only fear is that he will not interest you. He
seems almost too perfect for earth. Think of a
young man who knows nothing of women, who says
he has no idea what it is to be in love, who does not
understand why the ladies who pass down Fifth
Avenue turn their heads to look at him! He, like
yourself, is a novelist, but his characters are beautiful
images that lack life. He carves marble figures
and attempts to palm them off as flesh and blood.
He really thinks they <i>are</i>, because he has never
known the difference. If you could take him, Miss
Fern, and teach him what love really is&mdash;"</p>

<p>The young lady blushed more than before.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i>&mdash;" she stammered.</p>

<p>"In a strictly literary way," he explained. "But,"
he added, thinking he was getting upon the edge of
a quicksand, "we must not forget the object of my
visit."</p>

<p>He took the parcel containing her MSS. that he
had obtained from Mr. Gouger, and began to untie
the string. Manlike he soon had it in a hard knot,
and Miss Millicent, coming to his rescue, her young
hands touched his and made his heart beat faster.</p>

<p>"There," she said, when the knot had given way
to their joint endeavors. "It is all right, now. But,
before we begin on this, tell me a little more about
Mr. Roseleaf. What has he written? Where was it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>published? I will send to-morrow morning and buy
a copy."</p>

<p>Her enthusiasm was agreeable under the circumstances,
but the truth had to be explained to her.</p>

<p>"What he has written I will let you see, one of
these days," he replied. "As for publishing, he ran
upon the same rock that you did&mdash;that of Mr.
Lawrence Gouger."</p>

<p>The beautiful eyes opened wider.</p>

<p>"So he rejected his work, too! And yet you say
that it was well done?"</p>

<p>"Exquisitely. Shirley's lines are as symmetrical as
his face and figure. His people are dead, that is all
the trouble. Gouger scented the difficulty under
which he labors, in a moment. 'Go and fall in love!'
he said to him, 'and you will write a story at which
the world will marvel!'"</p>

<p>Miss Fern arranged one of her locks of Titian red
that had fallen down.</p>

<p>"And hasn't he taken the advice?" she inquired,
in a low voice.</p>

<p>"Not yet," smiled the other. "He says, like a
very child, that 'he cannot find any one to love.' I
walked up the avenue with him to-day, and afterwards
rode in the Park. There were hundreds of
the prettiest creatures, all looking their eyes out at
him. And he hadn't the courage to return one
glance, not one. Ah, Miss Fern, it will be genuine
love with Shirley Roseleaf, if any. The imitations
one finds in the fashionable world will never answer
for him."</p>

<p>The young lady breathed a gentle sigh, as her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>thoughts dwelt on the handsome figure she had seen
in front of the Hoffman House.</p>

<p>"You may bring him here&mdash;yes, I should be glad
to have you," she said, slowly. "But I must ask
one favor; do not tell him what I said so thoughtlessly
about his being my ideal. Let me talk with
him on fair terms. It may be, as you suggest, that
we shall be of advantage to each other. When can
you arrange it?"</p>

<p>"Almost any day," smiled Weil. "I will let you
know, by mail or otherwise. And now, this story
of yours," he added, thinking it a shrewd plan to
divert her attention from the other matter while it
was still warm in her mind. "Though I have read
it through, and think I understand it fairly well, I
am all the more anxious to hear it from your lips.
You will put into the text new meanings, I have no
doubt, that have escaped my observation."</p>

<p>Miss Fern flushed pleasantly and inquired with a
show of anxiety whether Mr. Weil had found its
construction as bad as his friend, Mr. Gouger, had
intimated.</p>

<p>"To be perfectly honest, it might be improved,"
he replied. "But the germ is there, Miss Fern&mdash;that
necessary thing for a good novel&mdash;an interest
that will hold the reader in spite of himself. I
disagree with Lawrence in his essential point. I am
sure that a good writer of English with a taste for
fiction could make all the necessary alterations without
in the least detracting from the value of the
story. For instance, I believe if Mr. Roseleaf would
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>take hold of it I could guarantee to get you a publisher
this winter."</p>

<p>"And do you think he would?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I think so."</p>

<p>The authoress was so delighted with this announcement
that she conquered the slight wound to her
pride. It would be herself still who had drawn the
picture, who had put the coloring into it; all that
the other would have to do might be described as
varnishing. She took up the first sheet of her writing,
and turned up an oil lamp that stood upon the
table at her elbow, the better to see the lines.</p>

<p>"Are you ready?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Quite ready," smiled Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>In a voice that trembled a little, and yet not unpleasantly
to the listener, Miss Fern began to read
her manuscript. The opening chapter introduced
the heroine and two gentlemen, either one of whom
might be the hero. As the book is now so well known
it is needless to transfer its features to these pages.</p>

<p>Presently the authoress paused and seemed to
wait for her guest's criticism.</p>

<p>"That is one chapter," she said.</p>

<p>"Yes. I remember. And the second one is where
Algernon begins to disclose a very little of his true
nature. Shall we not have that now?"</p>

<p>"As you like. I thought perhaps you would give
me advice as we proceeded, some fault-finding here
and there, a suggestion of alterations."</p>

<p>He shook his head affably.</p>

<p>"Not yet," he answered. "Up to this point I see
nothing that requires condemnation."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nor praise, perhaps?" she said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"That might be true, also," he replied. "The
first chapter of a novel is only the laying of the cloth
and the placing of a few dishes. The viands that
form the meal are still in the kitchen."</p>

<p>She smiled at the simile.</p>

<p>"But even the laying of the cloth is important,"
she said.</p>

<p>"Your cloth is laid most admirably," he answered.
"And now we will have the castor, which in this
case, I believe, contains a certain quantity of mustard
and red pepper."</p>

<p>At this she laughed the more, and glanced through
a few of the sheets in her hands before she spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Did you form any opinion about&mdash;about <i>me</i>&mdash;from
this story?" she asked, constrainedly. "Did
you, in brief, think it had taken a bold girl to write
it?"</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, at last. "A bold girl, a daring
girl, a brave girl. Not one, however, whose own conduct
would necessarily be like that of the woman
she has delineated."</p>

<p>She was so pleased that she put down the MSS.
and leaned toward him with both hands clasped together.</p>

<p>"You are very, very kind," she said, impressively.</p>

<p>"No, merely truthful," he replied. "With your
permission I want to retain that last quality in all
my conversations with you. When you ask me a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>question I wish to be perfectly free to answer according
to my honest convictions."</p>

<p>"It is what I especially desire," she said, brightening.
"No one able to judge has heard anything
of this story except your friend, Mr. Gouger. I
know it is bold, sometimes I think it is brazen. I
can conceive that there are excellent people who
would say it never should have been written. To my
mind, the moral I have drawn more than justifies
the plainness of my speech. You can tell better
than I where I have overstepped the proper bounds,
if there be such places. You are, of course, a man
of the world&mdash;"</p>

<p>The protesting expression on the face of her companion
arrested her at this point.</p>

<p>"That depends on what you mean by 'a man of
the world?'"</p>

<p>"It is a common expression."</p>

<p>"And has many definitions. Before I plead guilty
to it, I want to know just how much you intend by
it."</p>

<p>Miss Fern put down the page she had taken up
and a puzzled look crossed her pretty face.</p>

<p>"You make it hard for me to explain myself," she
said. "I suppose I meant&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Now, be as honest as you asked me to be," he
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I suppose you are a man like&mdash;like
other men."</p>

<p>"But there are many kinds of other men."</p>

<p>The young lady tried several times to make herself
clearer, and then asked, with a very pathetic
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>pout, that she might be permitted to proceed with
her reading, as the hour was growing later. It was
not a very important point, any way, she said.</p>

<p>"I cannot entirely agree with you," replied Archie.
"If you are to be a writer of fiction, you should not
consider any time wasted which informs you in reference
to your fellow creatures. It is from them
that you must draw your inspiration; it is their
figures you must put, correctly or incorrectly, on
your canvas. Don't understand me as dictating to
you, my dear Miss Fern. I only wish, as long as you
have referred to me, to know of what I am accused."</p>

<p>To this Miss Fern answered, with many pauses,
that she had not intended to accuse her visitor of
anything. And once more&mdash;with evident distress&mdash;she
begged to be permitted to drop the matter and
return to her reading.</p>

<p>"Very well," he assented, thinking he had annoyed
her as much as was advisable for the present. "As
they say in parliamentary bodies, we will lay the
question on the table, from which it can be taken at
some more fitting time. I am as anxious as you can
be to get into Chapter II."</p>

<p>She read this chapter to the end, and paused a
few seconds to see if he had any comments to make,
but he shook his head without breaking silence, and
she went on with the story. He pursued the same
plan till the end of the fifth chapter.</p>

<p>"It is interesting, exciting and true," he remarked,
referring to the closing scene. "And I cannot help
feeling arise in my brain the question that Mr.
Gouger put when he read it: How could a young,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>innocent girl like you depict that situation with such
absolute fidelity."</p>

<p>He had come to the point with a vengeance. But
to Miss Fern his manner was far more agreeable
than if he had approached it by stealth, or in an
insinuating way. She had anticipated something of
the sort and had tried to prepare herself to meet it.</p>

<p>"Does not nature teach us some things?" she
asked, speaking straightforwardly, though her color
heightened in spite of her efforts. "Given a certain
condition, an intelligent mind can prophesy results."</p>

<p>He shook his head in mild disagreement with
her.</p>

<p>"Gouger is an expert, and he denies this, as a regular
rule, at least. You should have heard him
argue it with Roseleaf. 'Either throw yourself into
a love affair,' he said, 'or never try to depict one.'
Excuse me, Miss Fern, you bade me be frank&mdash;"</p>

<p>She assented, with a grave nod of her shapely
head.</p>

<p>"You may have been in love&mdash;I do not ask you
whether you have or not&mdash;but you cannot have
known personally of the sort of love that you have
depicted in these pages. I call it little less than
miraculous that you should draw the scene so accurately."</p>

<p>She colored again, this time partly with pleasure,
for she was very susceptible to compliments.</p>

<p>"Perhaps your statement may explain to you,"
she said, pointedly, "what I meant a few minutes
ago by calling you 'a man of the world.' You
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>recognize at a glance what I had to construct from
my imagination."</p>

<p>Archie Weil's face changed as he realized how
deftly he had been caught. He had meant to pretend
to this girl that he was more than usually ignorant
of the nether side of life.</p>

<p>"Don't think too badly of me because I happen to
know what is clear to every man," he said, impressively.</p>

<p>"To every one?" she answered. "To your friend,
Mr. Roseleaf?"</p>

<p>"Ah! He is an exception to all rules. And yet,
Gouger says he can never write a successful book
till he is more conversant with life than he is at
present."</p>

<p>She looked troubled.</p>

<p>"With life?" she echoed. "With sin, do you
mean?"</p>

<p>"With the ordinary things that men know, and
that most of them at some time experience."</p>

<p>Her bright eyes were temporarily clouded.</p>

<p>"What a pity!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Yes," he said, for it was his humor to agree with
her. "It is a pity."</p>

<p>There was a pause of a minute, and then she asked
if she had read enough for one evening. He answered
that as it was now past ten o'clock it would
not be easy to get much farther and that he would
come again whenever she chose to set the time.</p>

<p>"You do not say much about my work," she said,
anxiously, as he prepared to go.</p>

<p>"Silence is approval," he responded. "I can talk
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>it over with you better when you have reached the
end. I have things to say, and I shall not hesitate to
say them then."</p>

<p>"When is it most convenient to you to come?"
she inquired.</p>

<p>"Any time," he answered. "I don't do much that
is really useful. But wait till you see Shirley. He
will atone for the shortcomings you find in me."</p>

<p>She repeated the word "Shirley," as if to test its
sound.</p>

<p>"You are your father's only child, are you not?"
he asked, thoughtfully.</p>

<p>"No. I have a sister, Daisy, a little younger than
I."</p>

<p>"And has she a literary turn, also?"</p>

<p>"Not in the least."</p>

<p>Archie arose, and Miss Millicent accompanied him
to the front door. The tall negro came to open the
portal, but Miss Fern told him, with the same quality
of dislike in her tone which Weil had noticed before,
that he need not wait.</p>

<p>"He is really a magnificent piece of humanity,"
said Archie, when the man had disappeared. "I
never saw anything quite like him."</p>

<p>"You admire negroes, then?" said the young lady,
almost impolitely.</p>

<p>"I like representatives of every race," he answered,
as if not noticing her. "There are interesting specimens
in all. I number among my acquaintances
several Chinamen, a Moor, a Mexican, Jews, Portuguese
and Russians innumerable. If that fellow
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>was not in your employ I would engage him to-morrow,
merely as a study."</p>

<p>Miss Fern took the hand he held out to her and
set the next meeting for Saturday evening. Then
she said:</p>

<p>"If you want Hannibal, perhaps papa would
oblige you. I certainly would do all I could to persuade
him."</p>

<h3>"HOW THE WOMEN STARE!"</h3>


<p>The next day Archie Weil lunched with Lawrence
Gouger. He wanted to talk with his friend about
the young author and authoress. Gouger listened
with interest to the story he had to relate, and nodded
approval when it appeared that Archie had behaved
admirably thus far in relation to Miss Millicent.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about Mr. Fern?" he
asked, when the other had reached a period.</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"Well, neither did I, a week ago, but I have taken
pains to inform myself. He is a highly respectable
elderly party, who deals in wool. He married a very
beautiful lady, who has now been dead eight or ten
years and he lives altogether in the society of his
two daughters. If you succeed in getting Millicent's
book on the counters you will earn his everlasting
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>gratitude. They say he is not literary enough himself
to be a judge of its merits, and if she has fifty
copies to present to the family friends it will probably
be all he will ask."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil uttered a low whistle.</p>

<p>"I don't know what the family friends will say of
it," he replied, "but I call it pretty warm stuff. If
the list includes many prudes they will hardly thank
the girl for sending such a firebrand into their
houses."</p>

<p>"Pshaw!" said Gouger. "The world is getting
used to that sort of thing, and they won't mind it a
bit. Besides, they will be so lost in admiration of
their cousin's name on the cover that they will think
of nothing else. What did you make out of her?
Is she as innocent as I predicted?"</p>

<p>Archie poured out a glass of Bass' ale and sipped
it slowly.</p>

<p>"Quite," he said, as he put it down on the table.
"And she's no dunce, either." He went on to tell of
the trap he had fallen into. "I'm dying with impatience
to get her and Roseleaf together. They'd
make an idealic couple."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger inquired what he was waiting for.</p>

<p>"Oh, I want to do the thing right," said Weil. "I
want to learn her as thoroughly as I can, before I
bring him upon the stage. It will take three or four
evenings more to hear the rest of her novel, and
another to discuss it. I shall get around to him in
about a fortnight, at the rate things are going. He
will keep. What do you suppose he is doing now?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Writing poetry! He sent a piece a few days ago to
the <i>Century</i>, and they accepted it."</p>

<p>"He will be gray when it appears," said the critic.
"It takes a long time for anything to see the light
in that publication."</p>

<p>"But in this case an exception will be made," said
Weil. "They have assured him that it will come
out in their very next issue. He will be so proud to
see his name in print that I expect to find difficulty
in holding him back. A poet who appears in the
Century has certainly stepped a little higher on the
ladder."</p>

<p>The critic agreed to this, and remarked that such
a man as Roseleaf should give his whole attention
to poetry.</p>

<p>"Wait!" cried Archie. "Give him time. See
him after he has fallen head over ears in love with
charming Millicent Fern. There is something in
him, I feel sure, and between that dear girl and
myself we will bring it out. By-the-way, there is a
character I want you to meet," he added, as Mr.
Walker Boggs came into the room. "You have
never had the pleasure, I think, though you have
heard me speak of him."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs had his attention attracted by a waiter
who was sent for the purpose and came with great
willingness to occupy a seat with Mr. Weil and his
friend.</p>

<p>"We were talking of a New York merchant just
now," said Archie, when the introductions were
over, "and it occurs to me that you, who know
almost everybody, may have some knowledge of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>him. He is in the wool business, I hear, and I think
you once told me you had done something in that
way. His name is Wilton Fern, and he lives at
Midlands."</p>

<p>"Do I know anything about him?" echoed Mr.
Boggs. "I should say so. He was my partner for
seven years, and I still have a little stake left in the
concern, on which I am drawing interest."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil showed his astonishment at this statement.
What a very small world it was, after all!
Then, after pledging his friend not to mention that
he had ever discussed the matter with him, he went
guardedly into the particulars of Miss Millicent's
book, and of his having called at the house for the
purpose of passing judgment upon it.</p>

<p>"I didn't know that was in your line," replied
Boggs.</p>

<p>"Well, it was this way," answered Archie. "Mr.
Gouger's decision didn't exactly suit the young lady,
as it was not very favorable. Mine will be quite to
her taste, as I view her abilities in a more favorable
light. Now tell us all about the family, as the only
one of them I have met is Miss Millicent. Why, this
is a regular find, old man! You should have told
me a week ago that you possessed all this information
that I have been aching to get hold of."</p>

<p>Thus adjured, Mr. Boggs entered upon his story.
From which it appeared that he knew the Ferns,
root and branch, and had dined with them dozens
of times.</p>

<p>"What sort of a chap is the pater?" asked Weil.</p>

<p>"A very well-kept man of nearly seventy, with a
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>great deal of what is called 'breeding' in his manner,
and a face like the portrait of a French marquis
cut out of a seventeenth century frame. He doesn't
look like a business man at all, and between ourselves
he's not much of a one. All the money he
ever made&mdash;saving my apparent egotism&mdash;was when
I was in the concern. I've heard he's got a big
mortgage on his residence and is going down hill
generally. Too bad; nice fellow; sorry for him;
such is life."</p>

<p>Archie asked if Boggs would do him a personal
and particular favor, if it would not cause him much
trouble; and on being answered in the affirmative,
said he would esteem it a great honor if he could be
introduced to Mr. Fern by that gentleman's former
business associate.</p>

<p>"I suppose I shall run across him at Midlands,
some evening," he said, "and get one of those presentations
that are the most aggravating things in
the world. I don't want that to happen, and the
best way, to use an elegant phrase, is to take the
bull by the horns, or in this case, the sheep by the
tail. Will you make an accidental call on him
to-morrow afternoon and let me be of the party?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs responded that he would be delighted.
And this matter being settled, all parties could give
more direct attention to their lunch than they had
been doing for the preceding ten minutes.</p>

<p>"You must have heard of my friend Boggs, in the
days when he was a figure on the streets of this
town," said Weil, presently, returning to what he
knew was the favorite subject of that personage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
"You've lived here for twenty years, and of course
the name of Walker Boggs is familiar to you."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger looked a good counterfeit of complete
mystification for some seconds, and then a
gleam as of sudden recollection shot across his face.</p>

<p>"Certainly, certainly!" he said. "Mr. Boggs was
what is popularly known as a lady killer, if I am not
mistaken. You got married, did you not, Mr. Boggs,
some ten or eleven years ago?"</p>

<p>The party addressed acknowledged the practical
correctness of the date.</p>

<p>"Why, it comes back as plain as day," said the
critic. "The <i>Herald</i> had a page about you, including
your portrait and some verses by a well known
poet. It said your marriage had cast a gloom over
Manhattan Island and some of the up-river counties."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs gloomily nodded, to show that the
statement was true. Then he touched his most
rotund portion with a significant look.</p>

<p>"I'm a widower now," he said, "and nothing but
this&mdash;<i>this</i>&mdash;stands in my way. As Shakespeare says,
'&rsquo;Tis not as deep as a well, nor as wide as a church
door, but&mdash;' The ladies never look at me now, and
all on account of this d&mdash;d flesh, which hangs like
a millstone around my neck."</p>

<p>Cutt &amp; Slashem's critic, ignoring the peculiar
character of the metaphor used, remarked politely
that he thought no lady of sense would put great
stress on such an insignificant matter.</p>

<p>"Insignificant!" echoed Boggs. "I'll bet it's
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>fifty inches around, come! And it's not the 'ladies
of sense' I'm after. Quite the contrary."</p>

<p>One of Archie Weil's explosive laughs followed
this statement, which caused an expression of mild
injury to settle over the countenance of Mr. Boggs.</p>

<p>"You're getting on toward forty, and you ought
to quit," said Weil. "Confound the women! Let
them go."</p>

<p>"That's well enough to talk about," replied Boggs,
gruffly. "How would you like to follow your own
advice?"</p>

<p>Weil uttered an exclamation.</p>

<p>"I? I have precious little to do with them, I
assure you. For a man of my correct habits I have
the worst name of any one I know. Everybody insinuates
things about me, and they can prove nothing."</p>

<p>"We'll ask Isaac Leveson about that," sneered
Boggs. "By-the-way, that wouldn't be a bad place
to take young Roseleaf to, when you get to instructing
him in earnest. I met the young fellow on the
avenue last night and walked around with him for a
couple of hours. He's a darling!"</p>

<p>"Roseleaf?" cried both the other gentlemen, in
one breath.</p>

<p>"To be sure. How the women stared at him!
I couldn't blame them; his waist isn't over thirty,
and he's as handsome as&mdash;as I was at his age. I
told him he could have all the loveliness in New
York at his feet, if he liked."</p>

<p>Weil smiled significantly at Gouger.</p>

<p>"What did he reply to that?" he asked.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, he had an ideal in his head, and none of
those we saw quite came up to it; for I did get him
to raise his eyes and look at the prettiest ones. I
drew out of him slowly that he would have nothing
to do with a girl unless she had red hair; that&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil uttered a laugh so hearty that it attracted
the attention of everybody in the room. Mr.
Boggs paused to inquire the cause of this outbreak,
but Archie assured him that something entirely out
of the present discussion had just occurred to him,
which was to blame for his impoliteness.</p>

<p>"A girl must have <i>Titian</i> hair," repeated Mr.
Boggs, accepting the explanation, "or he would not
consider her. He ruled out all the striking blondes
and brunettes, saying that he liked only those of a
medium shade. We came across one that answered
these descriptions, an exquisite little creature who
looked as if she would swallow him could she get
the chance. And then there came out another idea.
He would not think of this fairy because she was so
short. 'I want a woman five feet, four inches tall,'
he said, as if the article could be made to order, in
case the size did not happen to be in stock. Then,
would you believe it, he found a girl embracing
every attribute he had mentioned. Her hair was
just the right shade, her height must have hit the
mark exactly, her complexion was medium. But no.
She was too heavy. She would weigh a hundred
and forty-five, he said, quite twenty pounds too
much. If we had found a girl that filled all his
description he would have invented something new
to bar her out of the race."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weil remarked that he was not so sure of
Roseleaf's insincerity. He believed the right woman
would yet be discovered, and that a case of the
most intense affection would then spontaneously
develop.</p>

<p>"In fact," he added, "I have the identical creature
in mind. It is clear to us&mdash;to myself and Mr.
Gouger here&mdash;that Shirley will never write a thrilling
romance till he has fallen wildly, passionately in
love."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs smiled slightly, and then sobered again.</p>

<p>"Shall you have him marry, also?" he inquired,
pointedly.</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"Because it will finish him; that's why. The
romance in a modern marriage lasts six weeks. At
the end of that time he will be useless for literary
purposes, or anything else."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil shook his head in opposition to this rash
statement.</p>

<p>"My theory is," said he, "that a novelist should
know everything. To write of love he should have
been in love; to tell of marriage he should have had
a wife&mdash;a real one, no mere imitation; to talk of
fatherhood intelligently he should become a father.
How can he know his subjects otherwise?"</p>

<p>The stout man smiled significantly.</p>

<p>"And if he wishes to write of murder, he must kill
some one. And if he wants to depict the sensations
of a robber he must take a pistol and ask people to
stand, on the highway."</p>

<p>"Now you are becoming absurd," said Archie.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"No more than you," said Boggs. "You go too
far, and you will find it out. Let your novelist fall
in love. That will do him good. But don't let him
marry, or you will lose him, mark my word. Let
him contemplate matrimony at a distance. Let him
reflect on the glory of seeing his children about his
knees. So far, so good. But when you have shelved
him with a wife of the present era, when you have
kept him up nights for a month with a baby that
screams&mdash;his literary capacity will be gone. Make
no mistake!"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil, half convinced, and much surprised to
hear such wisdom from this unexpected source, made
an effort to maintain his ground.</p>

<p>"Nearly all the modern novelists <i>are</i> married," he
remarked.</p>

<p>"Yes, and nice stuff they write, don't they?
Namby-pamby, silly-billy stories, misleading in
every line! They are the most unsafe pilots on the
shores of human life. They start, without exception,
from false premises. Their chart is wrong,
their compass unreliable, their reckoning ridiculous
from beginning to end. Where did you ever see a
bit of real life that resembled these abortions? Do
lovers usually fall on their knees when they propose?
Is the modern girl an idiot, knowing less of the facts
of nature than an oyster? Is the conversation between
men and women filled exclusively with twaddle?
You would think so, from reading these books;
and why? They are written by married people,
most of them, people who don't dare step over the
line of the commonplace any more than a woman
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>would dare order her dressmaker to put pockets in
her gown!"</p>

<p>Archie looked at Mr. Gouger, who nodded a partial
approval of these statements. Mr. Boggs betook
himself with more interest to his chops. And
the other two gentlemen, remarking that time pressed,
bade him good-by for the day.</p>

<p>"I see you agree with him that I shouldn't marry
Roseleaf?" said Archie, with a rising inflection.</p>

<p>"There is certainly point in what he says," replied
Mr. Gouger.</p>

<p>"But&mdash;confound it! With the boy's disposition,
it will be a delicate business," retorted Weil. "I
don't know as I can carry him to the point of passionate
love for pretty Miss Fern, and then shut off
the steam when it suits me."</p>

<p>This matter was discussed for the next ten minutes,
as the friends walked along toward the office
of Cutt &amp; Slashem.</p>

<p>"I think you are foolish to delay so long introducing
him to her," said Gouger, finally. "I don't
see that you are making any progress whatever."</p>

<p>"Ah, but I am," replied Weil. "I am making
both of them more and more anxious for the meeting.
Shirley walks the street feverishly impatient,
and I have no doubt mutters her name in his dreams.
Millicent talks about her ideal of manly beauty.
When they get together failure will be impossible."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger laughed at the idea that Roseleaf was
"feverishly impatient" to meet any girl, and ventured
to predict that the young man would have to
be put in irons to get him to the residence of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Ferns when the time came; or at least to keep him
there.</p>

<p>"Just the point I am working on," replied Weil.
"Under ordinary circumstances I would have to
handcuff his wrists to mine, but I am making such a
strong impression on his imagination that he is
crazy to go. And once she gets him under her
influence&mdash;I tell you, Lawrence, she is no ordinary
girl."</p>

<p>"She certainly does not write like one," smiled
the critic, "either in her subject or her English.
You may make something of him&mdash;I rather think
you will&mdash;but not of her. Her ideas are wild, and
her realism a little too pronounced even for the
present age."</p>

<p>"She has truth on her side, you admit," said
Archie.</p>

<p>"Yes, to a remarkable degree."</p>

<p>"Well, that ought to be something, if Boggs'
estimate of the modern liar is correct. Shirley will
help her to style, give her his own, if necessary. I
am going to land both of these fish, if only to spite
you, Lawrence. You tossed them away with that
fine contempt of yours, and you will weep hot tears
for it before you die."</p>

<p>At the door of Cutt &amp; Slashem's they met the two
members of that firm, who paused to say a word to
Mr. Gouger. They were anxious for a new book to
bring out as soon as possible, and were regretting
with him that nothing worth publishing seemed to
present itself.</p>

<p>"You may strain matters, it necessary," said Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
Cutt. "We can't keep up on reprints forever. I
hope you made no mistake in rejecting that book of
Mrs. Hotbox. I hear it is selling well."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger's face was, as ever, immovable before
his employers.</p>

<p>"What 'Fire and Brimstone?'" he inquired. "The
authorities seized the entire edition this morning."</p>

<p>Mr. Cutt looked at Mr. Slashem, with a startled
expression.</p>

<p>"In that case, I am glad we escaped it," he said.
"We shouldn't like that sort of an affair, of course."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil, who knew both the gentlemen well, inquired
what they thought of Mrs. Hotbox's production.</p>

<p>"I have never seen it," said Mr. Slashem.</p>

<p>"Nor I," said Mr. Cutt.</p>

<p>The partners disappeared into the counting-room,
where they had an interview with a binder who had
offered to do their work at one-tenth of a cent a hundred
copies less than the concern with which they
were then dealing. Archie said good-by to Gouger,
and went off to find Roseleaf, with whom he had
engaged to take, later in the day, a ride through the
Park.</p>

<p>"How soon am I to see your paragon?" sighed
the young man, as they were making the grand round
of that famous drive.</p>

<p>"Within a week, I hope. Are you getting uneasy?"</p>

<p>"I am getting lonesome," was the gloomy reply.
"And I want to begin work."</p>

<p>"Well, it will soon pass now. To-morrow evening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
I am to hear another installment of her novel. Two
more sittings after that will finish it, I should say.
And the next thing will be&mdash;you. But have you seen
no one else in all this time that you care for?"</p>

<p>The young man looked aimlessly at the fleecy
clouds that hung low on the horizon.</p>

<p>"No," he answered.</p>

<p>"And you think you are ready for a passionate
affection, if the right person is found?"</p>

<p>"I will try," he said, simply.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil roused himself and touched his horse with
the whip.</p>

<p>"Try!" he echoed. "You will not have to try.
She will carry you off your feet, at the first go.
Shirley, I have found you a superb woman, that you
<i>must</i> love. All I want to feel sure of is, that you can
control yourself enough to behave in a reasonable
manner."</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"She belongs to an eminently respectable family,"
explained Archie. "Her father is a gentleman of
the most honorable type. She has a young sister,
who&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roseleaf, slow at all times, had at last begun to
comprehend.</p>

<p>"You surely don't think&mdash;" he began.</p>

<p>"Ah, that is the question! A novelist must learn
so very much&mdash;a novelist who is to depict the truth,
as you are to do. Where should he stop? What
experience should he refuse, provided it may be
utilized in his work? A responsibility that is no
light one will rest on me, my dear boy, when I have
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>introduced you to this family, and left you to your
own devices."</p>

<p>Roseleaf's eyes opened wider at these mysterious
suggestions, but he did not like to make any more
inquiries. Weil changed the conversation, calling
attention to the women they met, who turned their
handsome heads to look at the young man, as their
equipages almost touched his.</p>

<p>"What an awfully wide swath you are cutting!"
was Archie's exclamation, as the throng increased.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<h3>A DINNER AT MIDLANDS.</h3>


<p>True to his appointment Walker Boggs met Mr.
Weil on the following afternoon, and set out with
him for Wilton Fern's office. Though engaged, as
has been already stated, in the wool trade, Mr. Fern
did not have on the premises to which these worthies
repaired a very large assortment of that product.
His warehouses were in another part of the city, and
all the wool that was visible to his customers was
arranged in sample lots that would easily have gone
into a barrel. Mr. Weil, notwithstanding the description
that Boggs had given of his ex-partner,
was not prepared to see such an exceedingly fine
specimen of humanity as the one introduced to him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
The word "gentleman" was written in large characters
on his broad forehead and in every word he
spoke. It certainly was not often, said Archie to himself,
that one encountered that sort of man in business.</p>

<p>"I have already heard something of you, sir," said
Mr. Fern, affably, but with the dignity that was a
part of his nature, no more to be discarded than his
eyes. "That is, if you are the same gentleman that
has kindly offered to assist my daughter in arranging
a story she has written."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil admitted the correctness of the supposition,
but disclaimed any special credit for what he
had done. He explained briefly how he was drawn
into the case. The visit lasted upwards of an hour,
during which the conversation wandered from literature
to business and politics, and all sorts of things.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil could not tell from Mr. Fern's manner
of alluding to his daughter's work whether he had a
very high idea of its value or not. Indeed, there
was very little to be learned from this grave gentleman
that was not expressed in the language he used.
He was inclined, Archie thought, to reticence, for
when there was a lull in the conversation it was
always one of the others who had to start it going.
The thing that might be counted a substantial gain,
out of the whole affair, was an invitation to dinner
for the following Wednesday, in which Mr. Roseleaf
was included, and Mr. Boggs also.</p>

<p>Before the Wednesday set for the formal dinner at
the Ferns', Mr. Weil had heard the whole of Miss
Millicent's novel read by the lips of that charming
young woman. There was certainly something very
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>strong in it, in spite of its grammatical faults. It
would be a very good story when "Dr." Roseleaf
had put it into a little better English.</p>

<p>The meeting between Roseleaf and Millicent was
most interesting to the one who had been the means
of bringing them together. The girl put out her
hand with a straightforward motion of welcome, and
it was accepted with something resembling timidity
by the young man, who did not even raise his eyes
to hers. The talk that followed was nearly all her
own, Shirley's part in it being largely monosyllabic
replies to her statements and suggestions.</p>

<p>When Miss Daisy was presented to both the gentlemen,
for the first time&mdash;Mr. Boggs she remembered
very well&mdash;she drew their attention for a few
moments from her sister, but soon relapsed into the
more insignificant place which she seemed to prefer.
She was not as large in any way, as Millicent, and
did not seem likely to become so. Her hair was of
a soft shade of light brown, and her eyes a decided
blue. In the presence of her sister she did not expect
to shine, and was evidently relieved when she
could go into a corner and talk over times long
past with Walker Boggs.</p>

<p>Mr. Fern came in rather late, but still before the
hour announced for dinner. He had his habitual
look of quiet elegance, but withal an expression of
care about his face, that Weil attributed to the business
troubles of which Boggs had spoken. The
manner of the daughters toward him was marked by
the watchful eyes of the chief conspirator. Millicent
merely looked up and said, "Papa, this is Mr. Rose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>leaf,
of whom we have spoken," and then when the
greetings that followed were exchanged, went on
talking with those about her as if there had been no
interruption. Daisy, on the other hand, crept softly
to her father's side, and putting an arm around his
neck, kissed him when she thought no one observed
her.</p>

<p>"You are tired, papa," she whispered.</p>

<p>"No, no!" he said, brightening. "I am very
well."</p>

<p>It was at the table that Mr. Fern had his first conversation
with Roseleaf, and the two men got along
nicely together. Shirley acquitted himself creditably.
Weil, who saw everything, noticed that the negro,
Hannibal, in superintending the service in the
dining-room, lingered more about Miss Daisy's chair
than any other, and took extra pains to see that her
wants were anticipated. In spite of this, however,
Mr. Fern frequently asked his younger daughter to
have more of certain dishes, as if his mind was constantly
turned in that direction.</p>

<p>"How long do you think it will require to do the
work you have so generously undertaken?" asked
Mr. Fern of Roseleaf, when the dessert was reached.</p>

<p>"It is impossible to say," stammered the young
man. "Some weeks, at least."</p>

<p>"So I supposed," said Mr. Fern. "That being
the case I wish to tender you the hospitality of my
home. It would be a great deal of trouble for you
to come every day from the city, and I know we
could make you comfortable here."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Roseleaf was about to decline the offer with
thanks, when Mr. Weil spoke to him in a low tone.</p>

<p>"Take it, by all means," he said. "It's a chance
in a lifetime. You know nothing of family life.
Don't dream of refusing."</p>

<p>The delay allowed Miss Millicent to add her
request to that of her father, and fearing to let his
proteg&eacute; answer, Mr. Weil boldly spoke for him.</p>

<p>"It is a good idea," he said. "He will have his
baggage brought up to-morrow. There's nothing
like being on the ground, when there's work to be
done. And, with the general permission, I am going
to run out pretty often myself, to see how things
progress."</p>

<p>The bright, off-hand way of the last speaker seemed
to please Mr. Fern, for he heartily seconded this
suggestion. When the table was vacated, Mr. Fern
asked if he might be excused for a few minutes,
while he wrote a couple of important letters, and
requested Walker Boggs to show the guests through
the grounds, where they could smoke their cigars till
he returned.</p>

<p>Accordingly Weil and Roseleaf accompanied their
new guide out of doors and across an extensive lawn
to an arbor at the further end, where a handsome
prospect of the Hudson unfolded itself. As Archie
was wishing for some feasible way of getting rid of
Boggs, temporarily, that gentleman espied an
acquaintance in the adjacent road and went off to
speak to him.</p>

<p>"Are you in love yet, you dog?" asked Archie, as
soon as he and his young friend were alone. "What!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
You're not! Don't let an hour pass, then, before
you are. The best of all proverbs is, 'Never put off
till to-morrow what you can do to-day.'"</p>

<p>"How can I do this to-day?" was the doleful
response.</p>

<p>"How can you help it, you mean? There she
was at the table&mdash;Titian hair, hazel-grey eyes, lovely
waist&mdash;everything. Love! <i>I</i> could fall in love with
that girl, marry her, get a divorce and commit
suicide, within forty-eight hours."</p>

<p>Even Roseleaf had to smile at this extravagant
statement.</p>

<p>"Do you want me to do all of those things?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Only the first one, at present. If you can't do
that, give up all ideas of being a novelist and secure
a place in some factory or counting-room. Everything
is ready for you. You are <i>persona grata</i> here.
Nothing can come in your way. Oh, don't exasperate
me!"</p>

<p>Roseleaf haltingly said he would do his best; and
the next day he came to Midlands, prepared to
spend a month or longer.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<h3>HOLDING HER HAND.</h3>


<p>For the first three days Roseleaf gave most of his
time to reading the MSS. that Miss Fern had written.
He could not say that he liked it, exactly, but that
was not necessary. To fill in the time, he consented
to let the girl read his own story that Gouger had
rejected, though he did this with trepidation, having
a dread that she would think it insipid. When she
had finished it, however, her delight was unbounded.</p>

<p>"It is lovely!" she exclaimed, in response to his
inquiring eyes. "I cannot see why they refused it.
I haven't been so interested in a story in years."</p>

<p>When he had read <i>her</i> story through he began to
rewrite it, departing as little as possible from the
original. As soon as he had a chapter finished he
would give it to her, for comparison, and criticism, if
she chose to make any. She proved, however, a
most charming critic, her shafts falling mainly upon
herself, for she declared that her novel seemed unworthy
of its elegant new dress. She conceived a
shyness toward this quiet youth, and blushed when
the striking situations and bold language of her tale
came into the conversation. It was so different from
his own work!</p>

<p>"It is too bold. I am sure it is," she said, repeatedly.
"I ought to begin again. My plot has too
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>much freedom, too little conventionality. People
will say a very strange girl must have written it."</p>

<p>And he would tell her that he did not think so; that
the strength of her ideas was very great, and that the
public would find excuses enough for anything that
interested and entertained it. He even added that
he wished he possessed her knowledge, her insight
into life, her fearlessness to tread on any ground that
her subject made desirable.</p>

<p>Between them they were doing very good work,
without doubt. Mr. Weil took some of the completed
chapters to Lawrence Gouger, who returned them
with a smile that spoke volumes. Cutt &amp; Slashem
would take the story when it was ready, if the subsequent
pages kept up to the mark of the first ones.</p>

<p>"Don't forget your own book," said Gouger, in a
note he enclosed for Roseleaf.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil was not backward in accepting the cordial
invitation he had had to join the Ferns at dinner
whenever he could make it convenient. Besides this
he called frequently at the wool office, and ingratiated
himself into Mr. Fern's good graces in many ways.
Within a fortnight he knew all there was to be known
about wool, in which he seemed to have conceived a
great interest. In his talks with Roseleaf he spoke
learnedly on this subject, referring to the foreign and
domestic staples, like one who had made the matter
a life study.</p>

<p>"What a queer thing trade is!" he exclaimed, on
one of these occasions. "Here we find a man who
ought to adorn an atelier, or a seat in Congress, and
yet is obliged to guide his entire existence by the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>price of such a confoundedly dull thing as the hair
on a sheep's back. He votes a certain political ticket
on account of the attitude of the party on Wool; he
dines off mutton and lambs' tongues; he casts his
lot with the Sheep at church. I don't know but
he would feel a genuine pleasure in having Wool
pulled over his eyes. And still I am convinced that
he never ought to have been in the Wool business at
all, and that Boggs&mdash;what a drop&mdash;is right in his
impression that it will eventually swamp him."</p>

<p>Roseleaf asked how Mr. Fern got into the trade in
the first place.</p>

<p>"Well, as I understand it, Boggs was looking for a
partner. Mrs. Fern had some cash and her husband
wanted to put it into a good thing, from a financial
standpoint. They did well while they were together.
When Boggs pulled out they had a clear $200,000
apiece. Boggs&mdash;confound him!&mdash;has his yet; Fern
hasn't. He's proud as the devil, and didn't tell me
this, by any means. It would break him up completely
to have to go into bankruptcy. Really, I
wish I could do something for him."</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"Why, I've got a fair amount of money," explained
Archie, "and perhaps a lift over these hard times
might be the making of him. I'm not particularly a
philanthropist, but I like this fellow wonderfully
well for such a new acquaintance. I shall give him
a delicate hint in a day or two, and if I can fix things
without too much risk&mdash;we have to protect ourselves,
you know&mdash;I am willing to do so."</p>

<p>This struck Shirley Roseleaf as rather odd. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>had never thought about Mr. Weil in that way.
Whether he was rich or poor had never entered his
head. He began to wonder if he was very wealthy.
He certainly lived well, and had no visible occupation
of the sort the census takers call "gainful."</p>

<p>"It is an interesting family, though," pursued
Archie, in his rambling way. "I wish I could get
into it as you did, you rascal, and observe it at
shorter range. Even the servants are worth studying.
Look at that Hannibal; who can say that the
African race is inferior when it produces such
marvels! I can hardly take my eyes off the black
paragon when he is present. How he passes the
soup&mdash;as if it were some heavenly decoction, made
by the gods themselves and sent to earth by
their favorite messenger! With what grace he
opens the carriage door! with what majesty he
mounts to his seat by the driver! I wonder if he
has a sister. She would be worth a journey to see.
I have met such women on their native soil, statuesque,
slender, full-breasted, square-shouldered, with
jars of water on their heads and clinking silver
anklets. What a cursed thing is our American prejudice
against color! No other people carries it to
such an extent. In the Latin Quarter the West
India blacks are prime favorites with the pretty
grisettes."</p>

<p>The young man could not help a slight shiver at
this information. He did not in the least agree
with the sentiments his friend was advancing, but
neither did he think it wise to contradict him.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then there is the little one&mdash;Miss Daisy"&mdash;continued
Weil, branching suddenly into that topic.
"So quiet, so self-abased, as if she would not for the
world attract one glance that might be claimed by
her elder sister, who is perfectly willing to be a
monopolist of attention. A nice girl, sweet as a
fresh-plucked lily. There must be treasures hidden
under all that reticence. Still waters run deep, the
silent swine devour the milk. I think I ought to investigate
the child. If you are to have that aggregation
of beauty known as Millicent, what prevents
me from securing a slight hold in the affections of
the junior?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf shook his head in a way that might have
meant almost anything. He never could tell how
much in earnest his friend was when he took up a
vein like this. Neither could he imagine little Daisy
in the role of an entertainer for such a very wise man
as Archie, not only much her senior but a thousand
times her superior in knowledge and acquaintance
with things that people talk about.</p>

<p>"Keep your eye on her&mdash;she will be worth watching,"
said Weil, with one of his laughs at the sober
face before him. "She is worth almost as much to
a rising author as the negro&mdash;not quite, but nearly.
Then there is the pater-familias; is there anything in
him? No, he will be of no service to you. And
that brings us back to our superb Millicent, with
whom you must now be wildly infatuated."</p>

<p>Roseleaf shook his head again.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;not yet," he said.</p>

<p>"But, what do you do all the time? How can you
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>sit by the side of a pretty girl, and kiss her cheeks,
and put your arm around her, and yet keep from
falling in love?"</p>

<p>The younger man gasped at each of these suggestions,
like one who has stepped into icy water and
feels it gradually creeping upward.</p>

<p>"I have done none of those things," he faltered.</p>

<p>"None of them! Then I shall not let you stay
here!" cried Archie. "What does the girl expect?
That we are going to make her reputation in the
literary world and get nothing for ourselves? I
never heard such effrontery! She refuses to give
you the least opportunity, does she&mdash;the jade!"</p>

<p>More and more confused grew the other at these
expressions.</p>

<p>"You don't understand&mdash;you are quite in error,"
he articulated. "She&mdash;she has refused me nothing,
because&mdash;because I have asked nothing."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil uttered a disheartened groan.</p>

<p>"But this will not do, my dear fellow!" he said.
"How can you accomplish anything unless you make
a beginning? Rewriting the story that she has
written will not advance you one step on the path
you profess such anxiety to tread. That is only an
excuse&mdash;a make-believe&mdash;a pretence under which
you have been given quarters in this house and
allowed every chance in creation to learn your lesson.
Are you afraid of her, or what is the matter?
Does she overpower you with her beauty? Tell me
where your difficulty lies."</p>

<p>But Shirley could hardly answer these apparently
simple questions. He said he feared the trouble
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>might be in the formality of the situation. How
could Mr. Weil expect, he asked, that a spontaneous
case of love-making would develop from such a condition
of things.</p>

<p>"Stuff!" cried Archie, with a grimace. "If you
and she were members of a theatrical company, and
were cast as a pair of lovers, you wouldn't find so
many pitfalls. You would go ahead and repeat the
lines of your part, wouldn't you? All you want is
to do the same now."</p>

<p>"But what <i>are</i> the 'lines of my part?'" inquired
the other, dolefully.</p>

<p>"Take her hand once in yours and they will come
to you," retorted Weil.</p>

<p>Roseleaf reddened so much that Archie regretted
the severity of his tone, and hastened to turn the
conversation to something more agreeable. He
made up his mind, however, to have a talk with Miss
Fern, and at the first opportunity he did so. It was
on an afternoon when he knew Roseleaf was in the
city, and he came to the point at once, after his own
fashion.</p>

<p>"How are you and my young friend getting
along?" he asked her.</p>

<p>"Oh, as well as possible," she responded. "I am
learning to like him more and more. I really shall
be sorry when his task is done."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"There's a bit of selfishness in your words, Miss
Fern," he said. "Have you forgotten that he is not
here to be useful to <i>you</i> alone; that you agreed to
do what you could for <i>him</i>, as well?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>The girl cast down her pretty eyes in confusion.</p>

<p>"I am sure I have tried to be agreeable," she
replied, gently.</p>

<p>"That is not enough," replied Archie, gravely.
"What he needs is something&mdash;some one&mdash;to stir
his blood, to awaken his fancy. I told you in the
first place that you ought to make him fall in love
with you&mdash;for literary reasons. He must feel a sensation
stronger than mere friendship for a woman
before he can write such a story as will bring him
fame."</p>

<p>Miss Millicent did not grow more comfortable
under this suggestion. She remarked, after a long
wait, that she did not see how the end sought was
to be accomplished. Love, she said, was not a mere
expression, it was a deep, actual entity. Two people,
playing at love with each other, might afterwards
find <a name="Page_106t" id="Page_106t"></a><a href="#Page_106tn">that</a> they were experimenting with fire.</p>

<p>"I have heard," she continued, her fair cheeks
growing crimson, "that there are women&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then she paused and could go no further. But
he understood.</p>

<p>"There are women&mdash;thousands of them," he
admitted, "who would willingly do what I ask. If
it is necessary, he must go to them."</p>

<p>She wanted to say that she hoped it would not
come to that&mdash;she wanted to convey to her companion
the horror she felt for what she supposed his
words implied&mdash;but she could not. It was so much
easier to write of things than to talk of them to a
man like him.</p>

<p>"Do you call it quite fair," he asked, "to claim
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>all and give nothing? He does not require much.
Could you not let him take your hand, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Possibly, touch your lips with his?"</p>

<p>Miss Fern rose to her feet with a fierce gesture.</p>

<p>"Sir!" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Very well," replied Mr. Weil, shortly, turning
away.</p>

<p>The girl resumed her seat, with rapidly rising and
falling bosom. She was in a quandary. The suggestion
she had heard would have sounded from any
other lips like a premeditated insult. Coming from
this man the venom seemed to have vanished.</p>

<p>Roseleaf felt somewhat discouraged after his latest
talk with Weil. He wanted to make a start, to do
something, no matter how little, toward the object
he fully believed was to be attained. That evening
while walking with Miss Fern (for it was their frequent
habit to go out of doors unchaperoned) he
found himself unconsciously taking her hand&mdash;that
hand for which he had until now felt a genuine
fright. And she, after all her resolutions never to
permit anything of the sort, gave it to him, as they
strolled together along an unfrequented byway.</p>

<p>"I want so much to make a Name," he was saying
fervently. "I have tried and tried to begin such a
book as Mr. Gouger wants, but I cannot. Won't
you help me, dear Miss Fern? Won't you show me
what I lack? I know you can, if you will. They
tell me I have had no experiences, and that I must
have&mdash;not a real affair, you know, but an inkling of
what it is like. I have tried to say things to you and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>have been in fear that you would not like them, and
have held my peace. But now, I can wait no
longer."</p>

<p>In his exuberance Roseleaf spoke at last with
ardor, and even went so far as to attempt to put one
of his arms around the waist of the fair creature by
his side. On her part Miss Fern was nearly overcome
by surprise.</p>

<p>In one instant the timid young gentleman had
changed into the similitude of a most ardent swain;
but in the next he became again his natural self, with
the added confusion resulting from his excited and
mortified state.</p>

<p>"Let me take you home," he said, when he saw
that she could find no words even to chide him.
"Let me take you home; and to-morrow I will go
away."</p>

<p>Go away! She did not like that idea! Her book
was not yet finished, for one thing; and besides he
was a nice young fellow, and had meant no offense.</p>

<p>"There is no reason why you should go," she
stammered. "I forgive you, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Do you!" cried Roseleaf, grasping her hand
again in his joy. "You are kindness itself to say so.
I must appear very stupid" (here he half put his
arm around her again, checking himself with difficulty
from <a name="Page_108t" id="Page_108t"></a><a href="#Page_108tn">completeing</a> the movement) "and dull,
and wanting in manners, but you are the only young
lady I have ever known on terms of the least intimacy."</p>

<p>Miss Fern replied that she did not mind what had
occurred, and hoped he would forget it. She added
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>that she would do anything she could for him, and
had the most earnest wish that they should be
friends.</p>

<p>At the gate they paused, and in some way their
eyes were looking into each other. The girl laughed,
a relief to feelings that had been for the past ten minutes
somewhat overcharged.</p>

<p>"Well, you have made a beginning," she said, mischievously,
for she wanted to drive the sober expression
from his clouded face.</p>

<p>"A beginning?" he echoed.</p>

<p>"Yes," she said. "You have held my hand."</p>

<p>He crimsoned.</p>

<p>"You said you would forgive me," he murmured.</p>

<p>"With all my heart," she responded, putting the
hand in his again.</p>

<p>He felt a thrill go through him, but it was a pleasant
sensation.</p>

<p>"I came very near putting my arm around you,"
said he, looking away from her. "Do you forgive
that, too?"</p>

<p>She took the hand away and struck him playfully
on the cheek with the palm of it.</p>

<p>Then, before he surmised what she intended, she
ran brightly up the steps of the house and vanished.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<h3>"DAISY, MY DARLING!"</h3>


<p>It was Roseleaf's full intention to say something
about this adventure to his instructor in the art of
love, Mr. Archie Weil, but somehow he was not able
to summon the requisite courage. He had a delicate
sense that such a thing ought not to be repeated,
where it might by any possibility bring a laugh.
And about this time the novelist's attention began to
be attracted toward the younger sister, who had till
then almost entirely escaped his observation.</p>

<p>He noticed particularly the ceaseless devotion that
the black servant of the family exhibited toward her.
She might have been a goddess and he a devotee; a
queen and he her slave. Hannibal moved about the
girl like her very shadow, ready to anticipate her
slightest wants, while Daisy seemed to take this
excess of attention as a matter of course.</p>

<p>Millicent constantly showed her dislike for the
servant.</p>

<p>"I don't see how you can endure to have him
touch you," she said to Daisy. "He knows better
than to lay his hands on me. I have told papa often
that I want him discharged, and he ought to consider
my wishes a little."</p>

<p>To this Daisy answered that the boy, as she persisted
in calling the giant, meant well and was certainly
intelligent. Her father did not like to change
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>servants, for it took him a long time to get used to
new ones. So Millicent tossed her head, returned to
her collaboration with Mr. Roseleaf, and things went
on as usual.</p>

<p>Imperceptibly Shirley began to take an interest in
Daisy. She did not run away from him, and he discovered,
much to his surprise, that she was worth
talking to. She was not exactly the child he had
supposed, and she had the full value of her eighteen
years in her pretty head. He got into the habit of
taking short strolls with her, on evenings when
Millicent was occupied with Archie, and when, as
often happened, Mr. Fern was away with Hannibal
in the city. There was a sequestered nook at the
far end of the lawn, in which the pair found retreat.
Before he realized it, Roseleaf had developed a
genuine liking for these rambles, and was pleased
when the evenings came that brought Mr. Weil to
dinner.</p>

<p>Daisy was ingenuous, to a degree, if surface indications
counted for anything. The words that flowed
from her red lips were as unstudied as the pretty
attitudes she assumed, or the exceedingly plain but
very becoming dresses that she wore. After she
once got "used" to Roseleaf she treated him quite
as if she had been five years his senior.</p>

<p>"Are you a rich man?" she asked him, on one of
those early autumn evenings that they passed
together.</p>

<p>Her manner was as simple as if she had said that
it looked like rain, and his answer was hardly less
so.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, Daisy. I have not much property, but I
intend to earn more, by-and-by. Did you think,
because I seem so idle, that I was a millionaire?"</p>

<p>"No," she answered, a shade of disappointment in
her face. "I only wanted, in case you had plenty of
money, to get you to lend me some."</p>

<p>He stared at her through the half-light. Her
features were turned in a direction that did not
reveal them very well. What did she want of
money!</p>

<p>"How much do you need?" he inquired, wondering
if it was within his power to oblige her.</p>

<p>"Oh, too much, I am afraid. And I cannot
answer any questions, because the object I have is
a secret. I don't think my plan very feasible, for
it might be years and years before I could pay it
back. You won't mind my speaking of it, will you?"</p>

<p>Curiosity grew stronger, and as politely as possible
he renewed his question as to how much the girl
needed to carry out her plan.</p>

<p>"I don't know, exactly," she said, thoughtfully.
"Perhaps a thousand dollars a year for five or six
years; it might take less."</p>

<p>"It is a great deal," he admitted. "Does your
father know what you contemplate?"</p>

<p>The girl changed color at once.</p>

<p>"Oh, no. I should not like to have him, either.
He would say it was very foolish. And yet I am sure
it would not be. The money would do much good&mdash;yes,
ever so much."</p>

<p>The young man thought hard for a few moments.
A desire to see a brighter light flash into those
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>young eyes possessed him. He debated seriously
the idea of handing her his patrimony, as he would
have given her a pound of candy if she had wanted
it.</p>

<p>"I might give you part," he said, after a pause.
"Perhaps your thousand for the first year or two."</p>

<p>She looked him full in the face, and put both her
hands in his impulsively.</p>

<p>"You are too good," she exclaimed, with fervor.
"But you cannot afford so large a gift. No, I would
only take it if you had a very large sum, and could
not possibly miss it. I asked carelessly. I should
not have done so&mdash;I was selfish to think of such a
thing."</p>

<p>"I want to speak to you about something, also,"
said Roseleaf, after a strained pause. "I have
noticed of late that your father has some trouble on
his mind."</p>

<p>She started suddenly.</p>

<p>"Ah!" was all she said.</p>

<p>"And I have wondered if there was anything I
could do to&mdash;to aid <i>him</i>&mdash;to relieve him. Because,
I would like it very much if I could, on account of&mdash;of&mdash;"</p>

<p>She looked up inquiringly.</p>

<p>"I have been so much a member of your family, in
a certain way, that a grief like this appeals strongly
to me," he said, haltingly.</p>

<p>She paled slightly as she repeated his words.</p>

<p>"A grief?"</p>

<p>"Well, distress, annoyance, whatever it may be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>called. If there is anything I can do, I shall be more
than happy."</p>

<p>The girl sat for some moments with her eyes on
the ground.</p>

<p>"He <i>is</i> troubled," she said, finally. "I am glad to
talk with you, for I cannot get him to tell me anything.
He is greatly troubled, and I am worried
beyond expression. I can't understand it. He has
always confided in me so thoroughly, but now he
shakes his head and says it is nothing, trying to look
brighter even when the tears are almost ready to
fall. What can it be, Mr. Roseleaf? He has no
companions outside of his office and this house?
He sits by himself, and isn't a bit like he used to be
and every day I think he grows worse."</p>

<p>Roseleaf asked if Daisy had talked much with her
sister about it.</p>

<p>"No," she said, with a headshake. "I don't
believe Millie has noticed anything. She is so
occupied with her literary matters"&mdash;there was a
sarcastic touch upon the word, that did not escape
the listener&mdash;"she has no time for such things. I
hope you won't think I mean to criticise her," added
the young girl, with a blush. "I know you care a
great deal for my sister, and&mdash;"</p>

<p>She stopped in the midst of the sentence, leaving
it unfinished. And Roseleaf thought how interesting
this girl had become.</p>

<p>"Let me confide in you, Daisy," he said, in his
softest tone. "I do not care 'a great deal,' nor even
a very little for your sister. You see," he went on,
in response to the startled look that greeted him, "I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>am to be a novelist. To be successful in writing
fiction, I have been told that I ought to be in love&mdash;just
once&mdash;myself. And I came here and tried very
hard to fall in love with Miss Millicent; and I simply
cannot."</p>

<p>Daisy's fresh young laugh rang out on the air of
the evening.</p>

<p>"Poor man!" she cried, with mock pity. "And
hasn't she tried to help you?"</p>

<p>"No. She hasn't. And as soon as I get the
work done I have commenced for her, I am going
away."</p>

<p>The child&mdash;she was scarcely more than that&mdash;grew
whiter, but the shadows of the evening hid the fact
from her companion.</p>

<p>"You ought not to go," she said, slowly, and
rather faintly, "until you have made another trial."</p>

<p>"Oh! It is useless!" he replied.</p>

<p>"Is it that you cannot love&mdash;Millie&mdash;or that you
cannot love&mdash;any one?"</p>

<p>He hesitated, puzzled, himself, at the question.</p>

<p>"I never did love any one&mdash;any woman," he confessed,
"and perhaps I never shall. But your sister
seems peculiarly hard to love. Yet she is a very
handsome girl and equipped with a mind of unusual
calibre."</p>

<p>Daisy acknowledged this description of her sister's
charms. She remarked that it was strange that
such a combination did not suffice to accomplish the
desired result.</p>

<p>"There are people who do find her entertaining,"
she added. "Mr. Weil is one of them."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, Archie!" said Roseleaf. "He finds everything
entertaining. It is nothing worth remarking.
She is the exact description of his ideal in feminine
face and form. He once gave me the list of the
excellencies of a 'perfect woman,' and your sister has
them all."</p>

<p>The younger Miss Fern had her own opinions
about this matter. She <a name="Page_116t1" id="Page_116t1"></a><a href="#Page_116tn">thought</a> the innocent man at
her side had not quite <a name="Page_116t2" id="Page_116t2"></a><a href="#Page_116tn">gauged</a> the interest that Mr.
Weil took in her family.</p>

<p>"I will make a proposition," she said, with a light
laugh, when they had talked longer upon the subject.
"I am afraid it won't seem worth much to
you, and perhaps you can do better; but why can't
you stay here, and&mdash;if Millie won't do&mdash;make love
to <i>me</i>?"</p>

<p>Darkness is responsible for many things. In the
light, Daisy could not have uttered those words,
even in jest. There, when the sun had set and the
stars were not yet on duty, she found the courage to
make that suggestion.</p>

<p>"You are very kind," he stammered, when he
grasped her meaning. "But I do not think it will
answer. I am afraid love cannot be pushed to any
point without its own initiative."</p>

<p>"That is probably the case with <i>real</i> love," replied
the girl, "but an imitation that would serve
your purpose might be evolved in the way I have
indicated. For instance, you could take my hand in
yours&mdash;like this&mdash;and I could lean toward you in&mdash;this
way. And then, if you had sufficient courage&mdash;"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>Before he dreamed of doing it, it was done! He
had kissed her on her tempting lips, placed within
an inch of his own.</p>

<p>"You are too good a scholar," she pouted, rising
to her feet in some confusion. "I did not give you
leave to do that."</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon most humbly," he answered,
with intense contrition. "May I assure you that
the act was wholly involuntary and that I am very
sorry for it?"</p>

<p>She turned and surveyed him in the shadow.</p>

<p>"Are&mdash;you&mdash;<i>very</i>&mdash;sorry?" she repeated.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"Because I have made you angry."</p>

<p>"Do I seem angry?"</p>

<p>"At least, I have injured your feelings."</p>

<p>Her face was close to his again.</p>

<p>"Well, I forgive you. There, let us make up."</p>

<p>She raised herself on the tips of her toes and
kissed him twice.</p>

<p>All the blood in this young man's body seemed to
rush to his head and then back with violence to his
heart.</p>

<p>"<i>Daisy!</i>" he stammered. "<i>Daisy!</i>"</p>

<p>But she sprang away as he tried to embrace her,
and standing two yards off, tauntingly cried that he
did not know what love was, and that no one could
ever teach him. Taking up the challenge he started
toward her. She ran away, he in pursuit. She had
gone but a few steps when she tripped over an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>object in the path and went down. In trying to
stop himself Roseleaf fell by her side.</p>

<p>"Daisy!" he cried. "Are you injured?"</p>

<p>She did not answer. In the darkness he saw
her lying there so still that he was frightened. He
caught her passionately in his arms, and knew no
better way to bring her to <a name="Page_118t" id="Page_118t"></a><a href="#Page_118tn">consciousness</a> than to rain
kisses on her cheeks. As might be expected this
only served to prolong her swoon, which was not a
very genuine one, if the truth must be told, and it
was some seconds before she opened her eyes and
caught him, as one might say, in the act.</p>

<p>"How dare you!" she demanded, shrinking away
from him.</p>

<p>"Daisy, my darling!" he answered, his voice
tremulous. "I thought you were dead, and I knew
for the first time how dearly, how truly I loved
you!"</p>

<p>She laughed, not very heartily. She had hurt herself
truly in her fall, and her feminine nerves were
jarred.</p>

<p>"You are doing nicely," she said. "For a
beginner, one could ask nothing better. And now,
if you will help to rise, I think it would be more
proper."</p>

<p>"No." He spoke with force and passion. "You
must not think I am trifling. <i>I love you!</i> Yes, I
love you! <i>I worship you!</i>"</p>

<p>"I do not see," she remarked, insisting in spite of
him that she must assume a standing position,
"how you differ in your expressions from the lovers
I have read of in novels. It is quite time that we re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>turned
to the house. To-morrow, if you like, I will
give you another lesson."</p>

<p>Shirley was a picture of utter despair. His new
sensations almost overwhelmed him. In one second
the dead arteries in his body had leaped into the
fullest life. The touch of that young maiden's lips
had galvanized him. He could not bear to leave
her with those mocking words. But at that moment
a voice was heard in the direction of the residence.</p>

<p>"Miss&mdash;Dai-sy! Miss&mdash;Dai-sy!"</p>

<p>It was Hannibal, who had returned from a drive
with Mr. Fern. They could see him dimly coming
across the lawn with the girl's cloak in his hand.
Daisy, with one quick grasp of the fingers that hung
close to hers, said good-night to her companion, and
started in the direction of the servant. If she intended&mdash;as
seemed probable&mdash;to pretend she was
out alone, Roseleaf did not mean to share in that
deception, and he followed close behind her.</p>

<p>"Here I am, Hannibal," called Daisy. "Ah, you
have my coat. It was very kind of you. Has papa
come home? I am coming in. I did not think how
late it was."</p>

<p>The negro stopped as he saw the strollers, and
knew that they had undoubtedly been together.
What more he suspected no one can say with certainty.
But he threw the cloak upon the grass that
bordered the pathway and turned on his heel without
a word.</p>

<p>"Confound his impudence!" exclaimed Roseleaf,
when he had recovered sufficiently from his surprise
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>to speak. "I have a good notion to follow him and
box his ears."</p>

<p>The soft hand of the girl was on his sleeve in a
moment.</p>

<p>"Say nothing to him&mdash;<i>please!</i>" she answered. "He&mdash;he
is very thoughtful for me&mdash;of my health&mdash;and I
was careless. Papa must have sent him."</p>

<p>The touch on his arm mollified the young man at
once. He tried to make out the lines of the pretty
face that was so near him and yet so far away.</p>

<p>"We are to study again to-morrow, then," he said,
taking up her statement with an assumed air of gayety.
"At what hour?"</p>

<p>But she broke away from him abruptly, and ran
into the house without a word. Hannibal stood in
the doorway and Roseleaf thought he distinguished
harsh sounds from the negro's lips; but this seemed
so incredible that he conceived his senses at fault.</p>

<p>Looking at his watch the novelist saw that it was
still early enough to take a stroll by himself and ponder
over his new happiness&mdash;or misery, which was
it?&mdash;under the open sky. It was two hours later
that his latchkey turned in the door, and in that time
he had resolved either to make Daisy Fern his wife
or commit suicide in the most expeditious fashion.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>

<h3>"OH, SO MANY, MANY MAIDS!"</h3>


<p>The only disagreeable thing about falling in love
with Daisy was that Roseleaf felt compelled to reveal
the truth to Archie Weil. He believed he was
bound to do this by a solemn contract which he had
no moral right to ignore. Perhaps Weil might claim
that he had no business to fall in love with one sister
when his "manager" had picked out the other for
this operation. Be that as it may, there was no use
in evading the question. It must be talked over, be
the result what it might.</p>

<p>"Well, I know what love is now," was the abrupt
way in which the young man opened the subject on
the following afternoon.</p>

<p>He had ridden to the city, as Weil was not expected
at the residence of Mr. Fern that day. The hope he
had formed the previous evening of getting another
interview with Daisy had not materialized, she having
gone on some short journey before he could intercept
her.</p>

<p>"You do!" was the equally abrupt reply, uttered
in a tone that betrayed undoubted astonishment.
"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf reddened.</p>

<p>"It came to me all at once, last evening," he said,
avoiding the gaze of his companion. "We were
down at the end of the lawn, you know&mdash;"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie interrupted him with a sudden shout.</p>

<p>"Not <i>Daisy</i>!"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You are in love with <i>Daisy</i>!"</p>

<p>Roseleaf bowed.</p>

<p>"Upon my word!"</p>

<p>There was nothing in any of these expressions that
conveyed the information which the younger man
craved, namely, whether his friend approved what
he had announced, but he stole a look at him and
saw that he appeared more astounded than angry.</p>

<p>"You dear boy," he said, "I don't know what to
say to you. You blush like a maiden over the
acknowledgment. I am half inclined to believe
you are the girl in the case, and your partner in love
some great, strapping fellow on whose bosom you
intend to pillow your coy head. So it is Daisy, eh?
And last night it came to you? Tell me how it
happened."</p>

<p>Comforted in a measure by the good nature of his
friend, Roseleaf proceeded to give the outlines of
what had occurred, suppressing the more intimate
facts with which the luckier reader is acquainted.
He admitted the touch of hands, but did not mention
the pressure of lips to lips. He told of the
girl's swoon, but said nothing of the extraordinary
measures adopted to bring her to her senses. But,
while he made no insinuations, nor pretended to see
through the meshes in this net, the experience of
Mr. Weil served him in good stead. He could fill in
the vacant places in the story with substantial correctness.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't know what Miss Millicent will say to all
this," he remarked, when the recital came to a pause.</p>

<p>"I think she was just beginning to like you a
little herself. Most of our talk last evening was
about you, and when I mentioned, as I took my
leave, that you were probably out walking with
Daisy, I could see distinct traces of jealousy. I
want to be fair with my client. I told her that you
came there to learn love from her, not from her
little sister. If all this should result in breaking her
heart, I don't see how I could excuse myself. And
the other one, she seems such a child, I never
thought of her in that connection. Why, how old is
she&mdash;not over eighteen, I think."</p>

<p>Roseleaf answered that Daisy would be nineteen
on her next birthday, an ingenious way of stating
age that was not original with him.</p>

<p>"All right," said Archie, digesting this statement
slowly. "And now, what is your programme?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked surprised at the business-like
nature of the question.</p>

<p>"I mean to secure her consent to marry me, as
soon as possible," he said.</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"Why, see her father, I suppose. Isn't that the
most important thing to do?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil shook his head decidedly.</p>

<p>"Not by any means. You must not act with
undue haste. Mr. Fern would say she was too young
to think of matrimony, a proposition you could not
successfully dispute. Besides, should he happen to
give his consent and appoint a week from Wednesday<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
for the happy occasion, see what a mess it would
put you in."</p>

<p>The suggestion caused the brightest of smiles to
illumine the countenance of the listener.</p>

<p>"It would make me the happiest of mortals!" he
cried. "There is nothing that could prevent my
summoning the clergyman and securing the prize I
desire."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil grunted.</p>

<p>"H&mdash;m! And in the meanwhile what would
become of your great novel?"</p>

<p>This question brought a sober pause to the young
novelist.</p>

<p>"I could write it after my wedding," he answered,
finally.</p>

<p>"Could you? You could write nothing at all then&mdash;nothing
that any one would pay a cent to read. I
have told you from the start that what you want is a
<i>grande passion</i>, something to stir your soul to its
depths. You are on the verge of that experience.
Already you have had a glimpse of what it will be
like. For the first time the touch of a woman's
fingers has driven sleep from your eyelids. No, you
didn't tell me you laid awake all night, but I saw it
by looking at you. You can shut yourself up in
your room now, and rhapsodize over the dear face,
the lovely mouth, the soft voice of your beloved. In
another week, if this keeps on, you can write like a
combination of George Eliot (after she met Lewes)
and Amelie Rives (before her marriage). A month
later, Gouger might rave over your productions, for
you will be on the Matterhorn of bliss unsatisfied."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>A slight laugh, at his own excess of description,
issued from the lips of Mr. Weil, but the countenance
of his companion was as firm as a rock.</p>

<p>"You are right," said Roseleaf, gravely. "Already
I see the vast difference between this sensation of
love and the thing I imagined it to be when I wrote
those silly pages that Cutt &amp; Slashem did so well to
reject. But I am torn between two desires. I want
to write my novel&mdash;until yesterday I thought no
wish could be so great. And I also want my wife."
He breathed the word with a simple reverence that
affected even the flinty heart of his hearer. "I shall
never rest easy until I find her wholly mine, to love,
honor and cherish while God gives me breath!"</p>

<p>The hand of the elder man dropped heavily on
the table by his side.</p>

<p>"<i>Good!</i>" he exclaimed. "<i>Very</i> good! You could
not have said it better. There is an opportunity before
you to accomplish both of these things. I only
wish to impress upon you the fact that they must
come in the order I have indicated, or one of them
will never come at all. Write your story while the
fever of passion is on you. The dead calm of married
life would only bring the sort of novel that the
shelves are already piled with, nauseating to the
public and a drug in the hands of the publishers."</p>

<p>Roseleaf doubted the full correctness of these conclusions.
He thought, with that dear girl by his
side, he could write with all the fervor of a sweetheart,
for his affection was to have no boundary, no
limit, no end. But he had a high opinion of the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>abilities of Mr. Weil, and he had no idea of <a name="Page_126t" id="Page_126t"></a><a href="#Page_126tn">disputing</a>
the conclusions of that wise guide.</p>

<p>"Do you think she will accept me?" he asked,
wistfully, returning to the main question. "It came
so sudden, and there was very little said, and it was
late; and then Hannibal came after her, and she
went into the house. Everything was left in a state
of uncertainty."</p>

<p>"Did nothing show whether you were indifferent
to her?" was the wily interrogation that followed.
"Usually I believe something conveys the sweet
word 'hope' to the waiting one. And what do you
say about Hannibal? That he came to call your
charmer and took her away from you?"</p>

<p>Without reserve the young man repeated what had
happened. Archie seemed deeply interested, but
whatever his thoughts he did not express them at
the time.</p>

<p>"And that reminds me of another thing," said
Roseleaf. "Have you noticed anything strange
about Mr. Fern?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Weil, "I have noticed. I wondered
if you had done the same. Have you discovered
what the trouble is?"</p>

<p>"No, and Daisy doesn't know, either. Indeed,
she is much distressed about it. Remember, this is
a secret between us, for perhaps I had no right to
talk of their affairs. He is in a state of great depression,
and as he is so regular in his habits I can't
imagine what to lay it to. You are so shrewd,
couldn't you find out?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weil rose and took a few paces up and down
the room.</p>

<p>"You are the fellow to do that, not I," he said, presently.
"Yes, hear me out. You are in a sense a
member of his family, and would have a natural
right to allude to the state of his health. Then, if
you were to put in a word about Miss Daisy&mdash;why,
you might kill several birds with one stone."</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked much puzzled.</p>

<p>"I thought," he said, "that you wanted me to postpone
the matter of my marriage as long as possible."</p>

<p>"Your marriage, yes. But not the preliminaries.
They may require a dozen bouts with the old gentleman.
The first time he will probably laugh you out
of the room as a silly young noodle; the second he
will say that he has nothing against you personally,
but that his 'baby' is too infantile to think of such
things for ten years yet; the third he will begin to
see the situation in its right light, and after that it
will be only a matter of detail. All these things
will be of the greatest value to you in the novel you
are going to write, and you must not on your life
miss a single one of them.</p>

<p>"Drop into the wool shop, catch his royal highness
there, and for the first thing express solicitude
for his health. Unless he is on his guard more than
is likely you ought to catch some slight straw to show
what ails him. Then follow it up with a word or two
about Miss Daisy, and you will have spent a good
afternoon, even if he doesn't smile on your suit at
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>first hand, and take you to his manly breast as his
long-lost son-in-law."</p>

<p>The reasonings set forth in these propositions
were so evidently correct that Roseleaf resolved to
adopt them just as soon as he could bring himself
into the proper mood. In the meantime, however,
he wanted to have a little further talk with Daisy,
for he could hardly ask her father for her hand
without the semblance of permission on her part.
He tried to remember all she had said to him at
the foot of the lawn, and was compelled to admit
that it was very little indeed. The only things he
was certain of were the kisses, but his experiences
were so slight that he could not tell how much
weight to give even these.</p>

<p>That evening he tried his best to get a word with
her alone, but she eluded him, and he was obliged to
go to the boudoir of her sister and read over that
young lady's MSS. as it stood revised by his careful
hands.</p>

<p>"Well, another chapter will finish it," said Miss
Fern, when he put down the pages. "And then Mr.
Gouger will decide whether Cult &amp; Slashem consider
it worth printing."</p>

<p>"Yes," he answered, gravely. "They will print
<i>your</i> story now, without doubt. But <i>I</i> am as far as
ever from satisfying their requirements."</p>

<p>Millicent thought how supremely selfish she must
seem, talking always of her own hopes and doing
nothing to help the one who had made her success
possible. She saw that he wore a dejected look, and
she began to sincerely pity him. When our own
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>ships are safely in sight of the harbor we have
more time to dwell on the derelicts in which the
property of our friends is embarked.</p>

<p>"Perhaps, when we get this disposed of, I can
help you," she suggested.</p>

<p>It was nearly a week before Roseleaf could get
another talk with Daisy, a week that tried him to
the utmost, for he could think of nothing but her,
and could not understand her reasons for treating
him so strangely. At last he wrote her a letter,
giving it to Hannibal to deliver, in which he said
that he was about to return to his city lodging and
wanted to know if she meant him to leave without a
kind word at parting. He thought the negro looked
peculiar as he took the note, half as if he did not
intend to accept the commission to deliver it; but
he concluded that this must be imagination. He
wondered why Archie Weil took such a fancy to
Hannibal. If Roseleaf was lucky enough to claim
Daisy as his wife, he would never have that figure
darken his door.</p>

<p>The letter must have been taken to its destination
without delay, for an answer was brought in the
course of an hour, stating in the briefest language
that Miss Daisy would await him in the parlor, after
lunch.</p>

<p>At the table Miss Fern was present, as usual, but
not her father, his business in the city keeping him
away at that hour. At meals it was Daisy's habit to
say little, leaving the conversation to her sister and
whoever else happened to be there. At the end of
this particular lunch Millicent went up stairs to her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>chamber and Daisy betook herself to the parlor, followed
a few minutes later by the young man.</p>

<p>"Why have you treated me so coldly?" were his
first words, when he found himself alone with her.</p>

<p>"Oh, dear, that is a very bad beginning!" she
said, smiling. "I shall have to instruct you in some
of the simplest things, I see already. When you
wish to make friends with a woman, don't begin by
scolding her. I am here because you wrote that you
wished a kind word. Don't give me too many cross
ones, please."</p>

<p>He sighed impatiently.</p>

<p>"Daisy," he exclaimed. "I hope you are not going
to make fun of me! I have passed a most miserable
week. After the glimpse of heaven you gave
me, that evening&mdash;"</p>

<p>She put on an air of mock surprise.</p>

<p>"Did I do that! It was much more than I intended,
then. I fear you are inclined to use extravagant
metaphors, Mr. Roseleaf. But, never mind.
You are going away, and I am very, very sorry.
However, as you came here on Millie's account, and
not on mine, I suppose I have no right to say so."</p>

<p>The fair brow of the young man was a mass of
wrinkles.</p>

<p>"I can't understand why you speak so lightly,"
he answered. "You know&mdash;I told you&mdash;that I love
you&mdash;that there is nothing in all the world so dear
to me&mdash;that I want your promise to be my wife. I
can't go from here without that consolation. Daisy,
I ask you, in all sincerity, to say that as soon as your
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>father's consent is obtained, you will name a day
when you will marry me."</p>

<p>The smile faded from the girl's lips. Something
brought to her mind a very sad reflection.</p>

<p>"You ask a great deal," she said. "Much more,
I think, than you realize. Until a week ago I was
nothing to you. We lived under the same roof, we
took our evening strolls together, we talked like the
commonest acquaintances, and that was all. Then,
in a moment, you discovered that your heart was on
fire. I have not ascertained what made the marvellous
change. I am sure you cannot tell yet if it be
a genuine and lasting one. Were I inclined to believe
I ever should be willing to go to the lengths
of which you speak, I should assuredly want time
for the maturest reflection. In the first place, I
know almost nothing about you. One would not
engage a&mdash;a coachman&mdash;without more inquiry.
How can a girl promise to trust her entire future to
a man with whom she has but a casual acquaintance?
Such things need consideration. I know my
father would say so. And if he heard only the
nicest things about you, I doubt if he would like to
have you take me from him&mdash;especially now, when
his heart is heavy and he leans so much on my love
and care. No, you are in too great haste."</p>

<p>His impatience grew to boiling heat as he listened.
How could she find so many reasons, and (he was
obliged to confess) such sensible ones, to bring
against him?</p>

<p>"There is one thing you <i>can</i> do," he said, with an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>attitude of deep dejection. "You can tell me if you
love me."</p>

<p>She tossed her head with a feminine movement
that was wholly charming.</p>

<p>"Yes, I could tell you that, but it would be a very
improper thing, under the circumstances, provided I
was able to give you the answer you seem to wish.
If I did care for you, would I like to say so in definite
words when anything further might turn out to
be impossible? A girl would not wish to have a
man that she was never to marry going about with
the recollection that she said, 'I love you.'"</p>

<p>"Then you can say nothing at all?" he asked
sadly. "Shall I be uncertain whether at the end of
my term in purgatory I am to be raised to a state of
bliss or dashed into the Inferno?"</p>

<p>She laughed; a delicious little laugh.</p>

<p>"You are getting hyperbolical," she answered.
"There are ten thousand better women than I."</p>

<p>"But I don't want them," pleaded the young man.
"Did you ever read the lines of Jean Ingelow:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Oh so many, many, many<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maids and yet my heart undone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What to me are all or any?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have lost&mdash;my&mdash;one.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Daisy replied that the sentiment was very sweet,
and added that when a lover could quote such
admirable poetry with accuracy, there was hope
for him. Do what he would, Roseleaf could not
make her see that everything in his future life depended
on "one little word" from her. She persisted
that he was misled by the violence of his first
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>affection, and that if he would only let a month or two
pass he would discover that his pulse would fall off
a number of beats to the minute.</p>

<p>"And is that what you want?" he asked, reproachfully.
"Would you like to have me come back two
months later, and tell you my love had ceased?"</p>

<p>"Yes, if it was the truth. How much better than
to learn it after my vows had been pledged and I
was bound to you for the rest of my days!"</p>

<p>He rose and went with quick steps to her side,
catching up her hand and covering it with kisses.
She did her best to stop him, whispering, with a
glance toward the door, that they might be interrupted
at any minute.</p>

<p>"By whom!" he retorted, stung at her coldness.
"Your sister has gone up stairs, and there is no one
else in the house."</p>

<p>"Hannibal might come in," she said, in a low
tone. "He has no way of knowing that I do not
wish to be interrupted."</p>

<p>He grew angry at the mention of that name. But
the warning had its effect and he sat down, nearer to
her than before, his heart beating rapidly.</p>

<p>"I hate the fellow!" he exclaimed bitterly. "It
is a good thing I am going away, or I should strike
him some day for his insolence!"</p>

<p>Daisy paled at the vehemence of her companion.</p>

<p>"Has he been insolent to you?" she murmured.</p>

<p>"To me? He would not <a name="Page_133t" id="Page_133t"></a><a href="#Page_133tn">dare!</a> What angers
me is the way he speaks to the rest of you. He
came with your cloak that night, acting as if he was
your master, instead of your servant. I have heard
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>him speak to Mr. Fern in a way that made me want
to kick him! Why does your father bear it? Why
do you? Has Hannibal some mysterious hold on
his situation?"</p>

<p>The girl heard him patiently, though the roses did
not come at once to her white cheek.</p>

<p>"I am afraid," she said, when he had finished his
tirade, "that you despise him for his color. It is a
prejudice that seems to me&mdash;and to my father&mdash;unchristian
and uncharitable. Perhaps, in the
anxiety to make Hannibal forget that God gave him
a darker skin than ours, we may have gone to the
other extreme, and treated him with too great consideration.
But I think you overstate the case."</p>

<p>Her gentle words smote upon the ears that heard
them, and in a moment Roseleaf was affected by the
most lively contrition. Without attempting to
excuse himself he begged her pardon, which she
readily granted.</p>

<p>"When do you leave us?" she asked.</p>

<p>"To-morrow morning."</p>

<p>"But you will call&mdash;occasionally?"</p>

<p>"If I may."</p>

<p>His tone was so sad that Daisy assured him he
ought to have no doubt of that.</p>

<p>"I understand," she added, "that you have probably
helped Millie to a reputation that she craves
above everything, and she ought not to prove entirely
ungrateful. We have enjoyed your stay here, and
shall be most sorry to have you go. I should be glad
to think you would honor us with your company to
dinner not less often than once each week."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>For the first time a ray of light came into his
face.</p>

<p>"Oh, may I?" he cried. "Then I shall not be
shut off entirely from seeing you?"</p>

<p>"No, indeed," she answered. "Father likes you
and Mr. Weil too well&mdash;you will bring him, of course.
Once a week, at least&mdash;if it were twice it wouldn't do
any harm; and if it were three times&mdash;"</p>

<p>His face was now one bright beam of light.</p>

<p>"Daisy," he cried. "I believe you do not hate me
after all!"</p>

<p>"I hope you never thought I did," she responded.
"Why is it that a man can see no middle ground between
positive dislike and marriage? I expect to
like a good many men in the course of my life, but
I can only marry a very few of them."</p>

<p>He was obliged to laugh at this, and to say that
she would only marry <i>one</i>, if he had <i>his</i> way. Before
they had finished with this subject Roseleaf was in a
state of high good nature, though he had little
apparently upon which to base the rise in his spirits.</p>

<p>"Can't I say something&mdash;just a hint, if no more,
to your father?" he asked, getting down again to
business.</p>

<p>"Pretty risky!" she answered, sententiously. "He
wouldn't give you much encouragement I fear."</p>

<p>The young man caught eagerly at the word.</p>

<p>"You <i>fear</i>!" he echoed. "God bless you,
Daisy!"</p>

<p>Bearing in mind what she had previously said
about the unlocked doors, he did not attempt to suit
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>the action to the phrase. But his happy face spoke
volumes.</p>

<p>"You had best say very little to father at present,"
said Daisy, soberly. "He is most unhappy."</p>

<p>"I wish I knew what troubled him!" he exclaimed.</p>

<p>"I wish so, too, if you could aid him," she
answered, earnestly.</p>

<p>"Who knows but I may?" he asked, with a smile
that she hoped would prove prophetic.</p>

<h3>ARCHIE PAYS ATTENTION.</h3>


<p>Roseleaf took rooms at his old lodgings in the
city, and set in earnest about the work of beginning
his great novel. He had interviews with Mr. Gouger,
at which he detailed the slight thread of plot
which he already had in mind, profiting by the
critic's shrewd suggestions. It was decided that he
should portray, at the beginning, a youth much like
himself, who was to fall in love with an angelically
pure maiden. The outline of their respective characters
were to be sketched with care, and sundry
obstacles to their union were to be developed as the
story progressed. Gouger warned his young friend
not to write too fast, and to content himself for the
present with delineating the phase of love with
which he had become familiar.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>"Later on," he said, "when your hero finds that
this girl is not all his bright fancy painted her&mdash;when
it is proved beyond a doubt that she has played
him false, that she has another lover&mdash;"</p>

<p>Roseleaf turned pale.</p>

<p>"But that will never be!" he interrupted.</p>

<p>"It will, of course&mdash;in the story," corrected
Gouger. "She will lead him a race that will make
him an enemy to the entire sex, if she is used for all
the dramatic effect possible. People expect to find
immaculate purity in the earlier chapters of a story,
as they do in small children. With the progress of
the action they look for something more exciting.
To sketch a seraph who remains one would only be
to repeat the failure you made in your other effort&mdash;the
one you brought to me the day I met you first.
It is not the glory of heaven that attracts audiences
to our churches, but the dramatic quality of hell. A
sermon without a large spice of the devil in it would
be much worse than a rendition of Hamlet minus
the Prince. Put your heroine in the clouds, if you
will, at the beginning. The higher she goes, the
greater will be her fall, and the greater, consequently,
your triumph."</p>

<p>The young novelist shivered as he listened to these
expressions. How could he build a heroine on the
model of Daisy Fern, and conceive the possibility
that she would ever allow her white robes to touch
the earth? He might have constructed such a plot
with Millicent as the central figure, though that
would be by no means easy; but Daisy! Impossible!
He asked the critic if it would not do to send
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>the hero of the tale to perdition, while leaving his
sweetheart immaculate to the close.</p>

<p>"No," said Gouger, decidedly. "A man's fall is
not much of a fall, any way you put it. The public
is not interested in such matters. It demands a
female sacrifice, like some of the ancient gods, and it
will not be appeased with less. I expect you to be
new and original in your treatment of the theme,
but the subject itself is as old as fiction. You have
too little imagination, as I have told you before.
You must cultivate that talent. Having conceived
your paragon, imagine her placed under temptations
she cannot resist; surround her with an environment
from which she cannot break; place her in situations
that leave her no escape."</p>

<p>Roseleaf shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I never shall be able to do it," he
said.</p>

<p>"Pshaw! Don't talk of failure at this stage of the
game. All you have to do is to introduce upon the
scene a thoroughly unprincipled man of good address,
who is fertile in expedients. You will find
your model for that among a dozen of your acquaintances.
Why, take Archie Weil, and hold him in
your mind till you are saturated with him."</p>

<p>What did Mr. Gouger mean? That Mr. Weil
would actually do these dreadful things, would in
his own person perpetrate the outrage of winning a
pure girl to shame. It seemed childish to ask such
a question, and yet such a meaning could easily be
taken from what the critic had said. No, no! All
he could have meant was that Mr. Weil might serve
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>as a figure on which to lay these sins&mdash;that he could
be carried in the writer's mind, as a costumer uses a
stuffed frame to hang garments on while in the process
of manufacture.</p>

<p>"Then there is Boggs," added Gouger, with a
laugh. "You ought to find some place for a fellow
like him, if only for the comic parts of your novel, and
there must be a little humor in a book that is to suit
the mass. A writer for a magazine said recently with
much truth, 'He who would hit the popular taste
must aim low.' I think Boggs could furnish the
cheap fun for an ordinary novel, without too great a
wear on the writer. Go ahead, my boy. Write a
half dozen chapters in your own idyllic way, and
then get Archie to take you to a few places where
your mind will be turned to opposite scenes. It
takes all sorts of edibles to suit the modern palate."</p>

<p>So Roseleaf wrote, slowly, patiently, with devotion
to his art, until he had completed five chapters of his
story. And Gouger read it and went into ecstacies,
declaring it the best foundation he had ever seen for
a most entrancing romance.</p>

<p>"He has wrought his people up to such a superlative
height," said the critic to Mr. Weil, "that the
<i>chute</i> will be simply tremendous! How simply, how
elegantly his sentences flow! If he can handle the
necessary wickedness that must follow, the sale of
'Uncle Tom's Cabin,' or 'Thou Shalt Not,' will be
eclipsed without the least doubt. But, the question
still is, <i>can</i> he?"</p>

<p>"There's no such question," was the response.
"He must, that's the way to put it. Confound it, he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>shall! And the next thing for him to do is to take
a few visits with me to the underground regions,
where he can get such slight shocks to his literary
system as will enable him to take up the vein he
must work."</p>

<p>During this time Roseleaf did not forget the invitation
he had received to dine with the Ferns. It
did him good to see Daisy, although he could not
now get her for a moment to himself. He sighed to
her over the table, and across the parlor, after the
party had retired to that part of the house, and she
answered him with little bright smiles that acted like
an emollient on his hurt spirit. He had never found
the courage to beard her father in his den&mdash;of wool&mdash;and
was not even sure that the affair had reached
a stage where anything could be gained by taking
such a step. What he wanted was a word of assurance
from Daisy that she would wait for him till he
had made a Name in literature, or proved his ability
in some definite manner. There was no indication
that any one else was in the way; everything pointed
to a contrary probability. But there is nothing so
desolate as the heart of a lover whose fair one is just
beyond his reach.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil accompanied Shirley on most of these
visits, and knew very well what was going on.
None of the glances exchanged between the young
people were so much their exclusive property as they
believed. Had Archie possessed eyes in the back
and sides of his head, he could have seen little more
than he did. While appearing to devote his entire
attention to Mr. Fern and Millicent&mdash;principally the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>former, he found time to watch Roseleaf and Daisy,
and even the negro Hannibal.</p>

<p>He noticed that the servant was no less devoted
than formerly to the youngest member of the household.
He saw him hover around her at the table
like a protecting spirit, letting her want for nothing
that thoughtfulness could procure. And he noticed
that Daisy seemed as oblivious of this as she had
always been. She accepted these extraordinary
attentions quite as if Hannibal were some automaton,
acting with a set of concealed springs&mdash;a mechanism
in which there was nothing of human life or intelligence.</p>

<p>Mr. Fern was the same gentlemanly host as of
yore, with the same dark cloud hanging over him,
whatever might be its cause. Courteous by nature
to an exceptional degree he could not assume a
gayety he did not feel. There was some terrible
weight bearing him down, some awful incubus of
which he was unable to rid himself. The only
person who did not notice it was Millicent, and the
one it troubled most was Daisy, on whose sweet
young face the share she had in her parent's griefs
had already begun to leave its impressions.</p>

<p>Millicent's novel was soon placed in Mr. Gouger's
hands, completed. The original theme was unaltered,
but in its new garb of perfect English no one
would have recognized the rejected work. The combination
of the girl's strength of mind and the man's
elegance of diction was successful. The critic recommended
its acceptance without a word of dissent,
and Cutt &amp; Slashem even consented, on his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>suggestion, to forego the guarantee against loss
which they had of late demanded from all authors
whose names were unknown to the reading public.</p>

<p>"I have fixed it for you, Archie," he said, when
that gentleman next made his appearance at the
sanctum. "No deposit or guarantee, and ten per
cent. of the retail price for royalty. So take a train
to your inamorata's house and tell her the news."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil did not seem to wholly relish the announcement.</p>

<p>"In the first place," he remarked, "you have no
business to speak of Miss Fern as my inamorata;
and in the second you will pay her more than ten per
cent. or you won't get the book to print."</p>

<p>At this, Mr. Gouger, after the manner of all publishers
and their agents, proceeded to show to Mr.
Weil that it was perfectly impossible to pay another
cent more than the figure he had named; and before
he had finished he agreed to see the firm and
get the amount raised considerably, provided the
sales should exceed five thousand copies. In short,
Mr. Weil secured a very respectable contract for a
new author, and one that was sure to please Miss
Fern, if she was in the least degree reasonable.</p>

<p>"I wish you would hurry up Roseleaf," remarked
Gouger, when this matter was disposed of. "When
will you take him down into the depths and let him
see that side of life?"</p>

<p>"I have arranged a journey for to-morrow night,"
said Weil. "We shall go to Isaac Leveson's and
make an evening of it. Unless things are different
there from usual, he will lay the foundation
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>for all the wickedness he needs to put into his
story."</p>

<p>The critic nodded approval.</p>

<p>"He will probably have a Jew in it, then&mdash;a modernized
Fagan."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Weil. "And a negro. A tall, well-built
negro, who has a white man for his slave!"</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<h3>DINING AT ISAAC'S.</h3>


<p>On the following day, when Shirley Roseleaf presented
himself at the Hoffman House, he found Mr.
Weil awaiting him in a state of great good nature.</p>

<p>"Go home and make yourself ready for a dive
into the infernal regions," he said, merrily. "I am
going to take you to a place where the devil spends
his vacation, and show you a set of women as
different from those you have lately met as chalk is
from indigo. Be here at nine o'clock this evening,
prepared for the descent."</p>

<p>A vision of subterranean passages crossed the
mind of the listener, and he thought of tall boots
and a tarpaulin.</p>

<p>"How shall I dress&mdash;roughly, I suppose?" he
inquired.</p>

<p>"Certainly not. Put on your swallow tail, and
white tie. Vice in these days wears its best
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>garments. You cannot tell a gambler from a clergyman
by his attire. Dress exactly as if you were
going to the swellest party on Fifth Avenue. The
only addition to your toilet will be a revolver, if you
happen to have one handy. If you do not, I have
several and will lend you one."</p>

<p>If he expected to startle the young man he was in
error. Roseleaf merely nodded and said he would
take one of the weapons owned by Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>"We shall not use them&mdash;there are a thousand
chances to one," said Archie. "New York is like
Montana. You remember what the resident said to
the tenderfoot, 'You may be a long time without
wantin' a we'p'n in these parts, but when you do
you'll want it d&mdash;d sudden.'"</p>

<p>When Roseleaf returned, the hands of his watch
indicated the time at which he had been asked to
make his appearance, but Mr. Weil did not take him
immediately to the point of destination. Instead he
walked over to a variety theatre that was then in
operation on Twenty-third street, and after spending
a short time in the auditorium guided the young
man into the "wineroom." Here the ladies of the
ballet were in the habit of going when off the stage,
for the sake of entertaining the patrons with their
light and frivolous conversation, and inducing them if
possible, to invest in champagne at five dollars the
bottle.</p>

<p>Archie was, it appeared, not unknown to the throng
that filled this place, for his name was spoken by
several of both sexes as soon as he entered. He
nodded coolly to those who addressed him, and took
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>a seat at a table with his companion. With a shake
of his head he declined the offers of two or three
fairies of the ballet to share the table, and ordered a
bottle of Mumm with the evident intention of drinking
it alone with his friend.</p>

<p>Roseleaf slowly sipped the sparkling beverage.
He was cautioned in a whisper to drink but one glass,
as it was necessary that he should keep a perfectly
clear head. Weil remarked in an undertone that he
had only ordered the wine as an excuse for remaining
a few minutes.</p>

<p>"I call this 'the slaughter house,'" he added, in
a voice still lower. "Girls are brought here to be
murdered. Not to have their throats cut," he explained,
"but to be killed just as surely, if more
slowly. I have seen them come here for the first
time, with good health shining out of their rosy
cheeks, delighted at the unwonted excitement and
the amount of attention the frequenters of the place
bestowed. I have watched them growing steadily
paler, having recourse to rouge, the eyes getting
dimmer, the voice growing harsher, the temper becoming
more variable. And then&mdash;other fresh faces
came in their stead. There are killed, on an average,
twenty girls a year here, I should say; killed to
satisfy the appetites of men, as beeves are killed in
Chicago, but not so mercifully."</p>

<p>The novelist looked into the faces that were nearest
to him and thought he could discern the various
grades of which his friend spoke&mdash;the new, the
older, the ones whose turn to give way to others
would soon come. All of them were drinking.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Most had on the stage dresses they had just worn or
were about to wear in the performance. Some had
finished their parts and were enveloped in street
clothes, ready to take their departure with the first
male who asked them. And they were drinking,
drinking, either in little sips or in feverish gulps, as
they would at a later day, when the five-dollar wine
would be replaced by five cent beer or perhaps the
drainings of a keg on the sidewalk.</p>

<p>Mr. Walker Boggs soon came into the wine-room
and joined the pair at Mr. Weil's table. He called
for a whiskey straight, pushing the champagne aside
with an impatient movement.</p>

<p>"I won't punish my stomach with such stuff, even
if it <i>has</i> gone back on me," he exclaimed. "That
will knock out any man who drinks it between
meals."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil assented to this proposition, and to show
his full belief in it filled his own glass again and
tossed its contents down his throat.</p>

<p>"What brings you here?" he asked, quizzically.</p>

<p>"Those creatures," replied Boggs, with a motion
of his hand toward the members of the ballet.
"They're all that's left me now. <i>They</i> don't mind
the size of my waist. My hold on <i>them</i> is as strong
as ever. But <i>you</i> ought not to be here," he broke in,
turning to Roseleaf. "It will be years before you
get to this stage, I hope."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil hastened to explain.</p>

<p>"Shirley is merely observing," said he. "He
came at my request. We are going next to Isaac
Leveson's."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Boggs grew interested.</p>

<p>"So, so! You intend to show him Isaac's to-night?"</p>

<p>"Yes. Isn't it a good idea?"</p>

<p>The stout man shrugged his shoulders as if he had
nothing to say on that point. The movement was
essentially a Frenchy one and might have meant
anything.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you would like to go with us," said
Archie.</p>

<p>"What do you intend to do there?"</p>

<p>"Tell Mr. Roseleaf all the secrets."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs stared at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Isaac won't let you," he answered, grimly.</p>

<p>"Won't he? He'll have to. Why, what's the odds?
The boy won't give him away. And if he should&mdash;"
His voice sank to a whisper.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil then proceeded to explain to his young
friend that "Isaac's" was a peculiar affair, even for
Gotham. It had entrances on two streets. Into one
door went the most respectable of people, intent on
getting an exceptionably good dinner, which was
always to be had there, cooked in the French style
and elegantly served. At that end of the house
there were several dining-rooms that would hold forty
or fifty guests, and several others made to accommodate
family parties of six to twelve. If a couple
happened to stray in and inquire for a room to themselves
the head waiter informed them that it was
against the rule of the house to serve a private dinner
to less than four people.</p>

<p>It was evident that the establishment was con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>ducted
on the most moral principles, and in a way
to prevent the possibility of scandal. For though a
great many couples undoubtedly take dinners in
private rooms with the utmost propriety, it must be
admitted that such a course is open to suspicion and
might be used as a basis for unpleasant rumors.
Mr. Leveson, who kept this hotel, took great pride in
saying that nothing in all New York bore a better
name, and no amount of bribery would have induced
one of his employes&mdash;on <i>that</i> side of the house&mdash;to
vary the rules laid down.</p>

<p>But on the <i>other</i> side of the building&mdash;at the
entrance on the other street&mdash;ah, that was different!</p>

<p>If only the most respectable customers entered the
first door it was almost equally true that none but
those who lacked that quality used the second. Mr.
Leveson sometimes remarked with glee, at twelve
o'clock at night, that he would give a hundred dollar
bill for an honest man or woman in any of the
rooms up-stairs. The waiters had instructions to
"size up" all comers with care, and to admit no
accidental parties who might apply for entrance
under a misapprehension as to the character of the
place.</p>

<p>"We are all full, sorry to say," was the established
formula. "There is a very good restaurant just
around the corner, on &mdash;&mdash;th street." And in this
manner the shrewd restaurateur got all the custom
he wanted, while preserving the natural atmosphere
in each part of his dominions.</p>

<p>The meals served in these two places were prepared
by one chef, and served from one kitchen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
Thus the virtuous and vicious patrons were supplied
with exactly the same dishes. But on what may be
called the Good side nothing stronger <a name="Page_149t1" id="Page_149t1"></a><a href="#Page_149tn">than</a> wines
were found on the bill of fare. On the Wicked side
every decoction <a name="Page_149t2" id="Page_149t2"></a><a href="#Page_149tn">known</a> to the modern drinker was to
be had for the asking. Then, again, the doors of
the Good side were closed at eleven o'clock, while it
was often daylight before the last patron of the Sinful
side reeled into his carriage.</p>

<p>After a little more talk Mr. Boggs seemed satisfied
and consented to join the party.</p>

<p>Mr. Leveson was notified of the presence of the
newcomers and met them at the door. Isaac was of
a decidedly Jewish cast of countenance, slightly gray,
not very tall, and quite round shouldered. He put
out a lank hand toward Roseleaf, when that young
gentleman was named as a matter of introduction,
but put it down again when Mr. Weil curtly said
handshaking was out of date. Archie had seen a disinclination
in the eye of his friend to touch the fingers
of the Hebrew, and with his usual quickness had
solved the difficulty. The party entered a private
office at the left of the entrance, where Mr. Leveson
inquired what he should order for them to drink.</p>

<p>"You will order nothing, at present," said Weil, in
a contemptuous way that excited the astonishment
of Mr. Roseleaf. "When I wish for anything I will
ring. Who is there in the house?"</p>

<p>The manager of the establishment bowed humbly,
and proceeded to run over the list of his customers.</p>

<p>"There is Major Waters and his wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Together!" exclaimed the questioner.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh, no! The Major has the little blonde that he
has brought for the last month; his wife has Mr.
Nikles of the Planet. Then&mdash;"</p>

<p>But Mr. Weil interrupted him again.</p>

<p>"You'll let them run into each other some day and
there'll be a nice time."</p>

<p>"Never fear that. The boys understand thoroughly.
He comes earlier and stays later than she.
Besides, we never let anybody meet on the stairs.
The waiters cry out, 'You must go back; it is bad
luck!' if any of them seem in danger of running into
each other. They are as safe from discovery here as
if they were in places a mile apart."</p>

<p>Some one descended the stairs at this moment and
Leveson tiptoed to the door and opened it half an
inch to peer at them.</p>

<p>"You know I have no object in saying these
things," said Weil, "except to save your precious
self from trouble. Who is that going out?"</p>

<p>"Some new people; it is the third time they have
been here."</p>

<p>"Well," asked Weil, impatiently, "who are they?"</p>

<p>Leveson held up both his hands as if to beg a
moment to answer.</p>

<p>"They come from Brooklyn. I don't know their
names. I think neither is married."</p>

<p>"I have a curiosity about things," explained Weil
to his friends, "that I cannot account for. You
remember how Silas Wegg used to talk about 'Aunt
Jane' and 'Uncle Parker.' Well, I have the same
way of studying the men that wander in here of an
evening, with other people's wives and daughters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
There is so little really entertaining in this confounded
world that I seize upon anything promising
a change with avidity. Isaac tells me all the secrets
of his queer ranch, and they prove wonderfully interesting,
sometimes. You see," he added, addressing
himself particularly to Roseleaf, "not a couple comes
into this place that would like to have it known."</p>

<p>Roseleaf bowed constrainedly.</p>

<p>"And how does Mr. Leveson know them?" he inquired.
"They surely do not register, or if they do
their names must be fictitious."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil laughed.</p>

<p>"He has ways of finding out," said he. "There
are little birds that fly in at the window and tell
him."</p>

<p>"I should not think he would wish to know," commented
Roseleaf. "Especially when it is evident
they would not like to have him."</p>

<p>Archie laughed again.</p>

<p>"Let me explain, then," he said. "I need not
mind Boggs here, who is discretion itself. Leveson's
reason&mdash;of course, I can rely on your silence?"</p>

<p>The young face reddened at the insinuation that
he might betray a secret.</p>

<p>"I was sure of it," said Archie, so quickly that
Roseleaf felt at ease again. "Well, the reason why
Isaac wants to know what is going on is, he is connected
with the police."</p>

<p>Roseleaf said "Ah!" and opened his eyes wider.</p>

<p>"People who go to places like this," continued
Mr. Weil, "are of great interest to the guardians of
the peace. And by the police I do not mean the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>members of the regular force so much as the special
service. It is to the latter that we go when a confidential
clerk has robbed us or we become suspicious
that our wives are unfaithful. Nine times out of ten
the chief of the private detective office knows in advance
all we wish him to ferret out. When he has
told us that we will set investigations on foot, and
that he hopes to learn something of the matter
within a few days, he bows us out of his bureau with
an air that implies that we have not come to the
wrong party. And as soon as we are gone he turns
to a ledger, and in a few minutes has found an abstract
that tells him everything.</p>

<p>"Let us suppose," said Mr. Weil, "that a jeweler
misses twenty valuable pieces of <i>bijouterie</i> from his
stock. The circumstances prove that they were
taken by some one in his employ. He thinks of his
clerks, and cannot find the heart to accuse any of
them of such a grave crime. He goes to the detective
office and states his case. When he is gone the
chief turns to the book and finds this:</p>

<p>"'L. M. Jenkins, clerk at Abram Cohen's, Sixth
Avenue; about twenty-three, medium height, dark,
dresses well. Rooms at No. &mdash; Twenty-Ninth street.
Has been giving expensive suppers as well as valuable
jewelry to Mamie Sanders, No. so-and-so, Such-a-street.
They dined together at Isaac Leveson's on
such-and-such dates.' Etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>"Now, he can recover the jewelry and get that
clerk into quod in three hours, if he likes. Naturally
he won't expedite things in that way, because he
wants some excuse for running up a large bill, unless
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>it be a bank case, where he prefers to make a great
impression and get himself solid with the directors.
But he will collar the fellow and recover the stuff,
and all because he knew about it long before any one
in the store had a suspicion."</p>

<p>Mr. Leveson returned. Mr. Weil asked that one of
the private rooms on the second floor be put in
order at once, for himself and friends. He then inquired
what ladies were in the house unoccupied by
escorts.</p>

<p>"Miss Pelham has been waiting an hour for the
Judge," replied Isaac, "but I don't think he'll come.
He disappoints her half the time now. And Mrs.
Delavan, who has just come in, found a note from
Col. Lamorest, asking her to excuse him to-night."</p>

<p>Archie looked pleased.</p>

<p>"They'll do," he said. "Tell them to come and
dine with us. But," he paused, and looked at Roseleaf,
"we need still another."</p>

<p>The color mounted to the cheeks of the young
novelist, as he understood the thought that prompted
this statement.</p>

<p>"Not on my account&mdash;I would much rather not,"
he stammered.</p>

<p>"You will kindly leave that to my judgment," replied
Archie, impressively. "Remember, you are
not the instructor here, but the pupil. There must
be some one else, Isaac."</p>

<p>Mr. Leveson hesitated. He was mentally going
over the rooms upstairs and taking stock of what
was in them.</p>

<p>"There are two girls," he said, at last, "who used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>to work in one of the dry goods stores, but you
wouldn't want them. They are very strict, and they
dress plainly,&mdash;and I am afraid the other ladies
wouldn't like to associate with them."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil grew vastly irritated by this statement.
He brought his hand down on the table with a bang.</p>

<p>"The other ladies!" he echoed, angrily. "When
you tell Mrs. Delavan and Jenny Pelham that you
want them to dine with us, you know that ends it!
As to these shop girls, what do you mean by calling
them <i>strict</i>? What would a <i>strict</i> girl be doing in
<i>this</i> house?"</p>

<p>Mr. Leveson cringed before his interrogator and
made the old, imploring movement with his hands.</p>

<p>"Let me explain," he said. "These girls came
here a few weeks ago with some traveling men.
They took dinner, but Adolf says neither drank a
drop of wine. A few days later they came again,
with other escorts, and the same thing occurred."</p>

<p>"Why did you let them in?" demanded Weil.</p>

<p>"Because I knew the gentlemen."</p>

<p>Archie started to say something, but checked himself.</p>

<p>"And after that they came alone and asked to see
me," pursued Isaac, humbly. "They said they had
been thrown out of work, and thought there might
be an opportunity to do something here, like waiting
on the guests. And while we were talking, two old
customers of the house called to dine, alone, and
asked me if they could get some one to share the
meal with them. And, it seemed quite providential&mdash;"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie stopped the voluble speech by striking his
hands sharply together.</p>

<p>"Enough!" he said. "When the dinner is ready
send one of them in. That will make the three we
need."</p>

<p>In half an hour the dinner was ready to be served.
Then Isaac came with the information that the girls
refused to be separated.</p>

<p>"What a nuisance!" exclaimed Weil. "Well, send
both of them, then. We'll take care of them, somehow."</p>

<h3>A QUESTION OF COLOR.</h3>


<p>The next morning, when Roseleaf awoke, he was
for some time in a sort of stupor. Through the bright
sunlight that filled his room he seemed to scent the
fumes of tobacco and of liquor. The place was
filled, he imagined, with that indefinable aroma that
proceeds from a convivial company made up of both
sexes. He half believed that Jennie Pelham and
Mrs. <a name="Page_155t" id="Page_155t"></a><a href="#Page_155tn">Delavan</a> were sitting by his bed, more brazen
than the bell which, from a neighboring steeple, told
him the hour was ten. And surely, by those curtains
there, hiding the flame that filled their cheeks, were
the two "shop-girls," their pinched faces denoting
slow starvation. Boggs, and Isaac Leveson, and
Archie Weil were there, all of them; and the young
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>man tossed uneasily on his pillow, struggling with
the remnant of nightmare that remained to cloud his
brain.</p>

<p>When he was able to think and see clearly he sat
up and rang for a pitcher of ice water. He was consumed
by thirst, and his forehead ached blindly.
When he had bathed his head and throat he turned,
by a sudden impulse, to his table, and took out the
MSS. of the story he had begun. Slowly he read
over the pages, to the last one. Then, seizing his
pen, he devoted himself to the next chapter, without
dressing, without breakfasting.</p>

<p>It was four o'clock when he ceased work. He
realized all at once that he was feeling ill. The fact
dawned upon him that he needed food, and donning
his garments, he took his way listlessly to a restaurant
and ordered something to eat. As he swallowed
the morsels, he fell to wondering how much temptation
<i>he</i> would be able to bear, with hunger as a background.</p>

<p>He passed a good part of the evening in walking
the streets, selecting, instinctively, sections where he
was least likely to meet any one he knew. When he
returned to his room he read over the MSS. he had
written that day, and into his troubled brain there
came a sense of pleasure. Gouger was right. To
tell of such matters in a novel, one should know
them himself. Roseleaf could never have written
of vice before he saw Leveson's. Now, it was as
plain to him as print, almost as easy to use in fiction
as virtue. What was to follow? He pondered over
the plot he had mapped out, and it grew clearer.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy had given him no further encouragement&mdash;at
least in words&mdash;since that day she had said it was
"risky" to ask her father, but he felt certain that
she regarded him with favor, and that if Mr. Fern
put no obstacles in the way she would not refuse
to wed him when the right time came. He thought
it would be wise to obtain one more brief interview
with her, before proceeding to extremities, and determined
to do his best to draw her aside, when he
made his next visit to her house. This settled, he
went to bed again and slept soundly.</p>

<p>When the day to go to Midlands arrived Shirley's
courage began to ooze a little. So much depended
upon the attitude of his dear one's mind, which, for
all he knew, had changed since he talked with her,
that he fairly trembled with apprehension. He
avoided Mr. Weil, with whom he usually took the
train, and went out early. Alighting at a station a
mile or two away from the right one, he walked
through the woods, trying to think how to act in
case matters did not turn out as he hoped. Under
the branches he strolled along, until he came within
sight of the roofs of Midlands; and then he threw
himself at the foot of a tree close to Mr. Fern's
grounds, and gave himself up to reverie.</p>

<p>When he laid down here it was only five o'clock,
and he was not expected at the house for a full hour.
It pleased him to be so near the one he loved, and to
lie where he could dream of her sweet face and see
the outlines of the house that sheltered her, while
she had no knowledge of his presence. Just over
there was the arbor, where he had first had the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>supreme bliss of touching her lips with his own. If
he could get her to come there with him again&mdash;to-night&mdash;when
the others were occupied with their talk
of earthly things, and if she would only tell him
frankly that he might go to her father, and that her
prayers would go with him! A soft languor came
over his body at the deliciousness of these reflections,
but it was dissipated by the sound of voices which
presently came to him from the other side of the
hedge.</p>

<p>"I can't exactly understand, Miss Daisy," said one
of the voices, which he had no difficulty in recognizing
as that of Hannibal, "why you wish me to go
away?"</p>

<p>There was an assurance in the tone that Roseleaf
did not like. He had noticed it before in the intercourse
of this negro with his employers. There was
something which intimated that he was on the most
complete level with them.</p>

<p>"I want you to go," said Daisy, in her quiet way,
"because education is the only thing that will make
you what you ought to be. There are a hundred
chances open to you, in the professions, if you can
take a college course. Unless you do, you can hope
for nothing better than such employment as you
have now."</p>

<p>It made the listener's blood boil to think that these
people should be consulting in that way, like friends.
Daisy ought to have a better sense of her position.</p>

<p>"I will not refuse your offer, at least not yet,"
replied Hannibal, after a slight pause. "It may be
as you say&mdash;if I graduate as a doctor or a lawyer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
But I know that I live in a country where my color
is despised&mdash;and all that could possibly come to me
here as a professional man is work among my own
race. I should be a black lawyer with black clients;
or a black physician, with black patients. To really
succeed I should go across the ocean to some land
where the shade of my skin would not be counted a
crime."</p>

<p>Daisy's face could not be seen by the listener, but
he was sure it was a kindly one, and this made him
fume. The situation was atrocious.</p>

<p>"It should not be considered so anywhere," said
the girl, gently.</p>

<p>"It is an outrage!" responded the black. "Having
stolen our ancestors and brought them here from
their native country, the Americans hate us for the
injury they have done. In France, they tell me, it is
not so. Oh, if I <i>could</i> gain an education, and
become what God meant to make me&mdash;a man!" He
paused as if the thought was too great to be conceived
in its fullness, and then said, abruptly:
"Where can you get this money?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf's suspicions were now keenly aroused and
he dreaded lest she should bring his name into the
conversation.</p>

<p>"Your father would not give it to you&mdash;without an
explanation," pursued the negro. "And you have
no fortune of your own."</p>

<p>"I will get it&mdash;let that suffice," interrupted the
girl. "I can give you $1000 a year for two years, at
least, and I hope for two or three more, if you will go
to Paris and put yourself under instruction. Can
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>you hesitate to accept a proposal of that kind? I
thought you would seize it with avidity."</p>

<p>As Daisy said this she arose, and started slowly
toward the house. Hannibal walked by her side
talking in a tone so low that nothing more was intelligible
to the eavesdropper she little suspected was
so near. But suddenly the girl stopped, and Roseleaf
heard her cry with startling distinctness:</p>

<p>"<i>How dare you!</i>"</p>

<p>The voice that uttered these words was filled with
rage, and the girl's attitude, as Roseleaf could see&mdash;for
he had risen hastily to his feet&mdash;was one of
intense excitement. Then she added:</p>

<p>"If you ever speak of that again, they will be the
last words I will ever exchange with you. My offer
is still open&mdash;you can have the money if you wish it&mdash;but
never another syllable like this! Understand
me, Hannibal, never!"</p>

<p>Miss Daisy passed on toward the house, alone.
The negro stood where she had left him, his head
bowed on his breast, as if completely cowed by the
rebuke. Roseleaf's heart beat rapidly. What gave
this fellow such power over these people? How
could he say things to call out such an exclamation
as that of Daisy's, and yet hold her promise to pay
him a large sum of money, instead of getting the
prompt discharge he merited?</p>

<p>And this was what the girl wanted to do with the
$1,000, she had asked him to lend her! Should he
still give it to her? Yes, if it would rid the country
of that insolent knave who, from whatever cause,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>occupied a position that must be growing unendurable
to those who had to bear with him.</p>

<p>What had Hannibal said, that made her turn as if
grossly insulted, and speak with a vehemence so
foreign to her nature? Roseleaf would have enjoyed
following the negro and giving him a severe trouncing.
Though Hannibal was twenty pounds heavier
and considerably taller than he, the novelist had not
the least doubt of his ability to master him. He
believed the courage of an African would give way
when confronted by one of the superior race; and
at any rate, righteous indignation would count for
something in so just a contest.</p>

<p>There were no traces of excitement on Daisy's
pretty face as she welcomed the guests of the family.
Weil arrived at about the same time as Roseleaf,
coming directly from the station, and Mr. Fern arrived
a little later. Millicent looked her best, which
is saying no less than that she was a beauty, and
Archie told her politely that she ought to sit for a
painting. When the dinner was served, Hannibal
took charge as usual. Shirley watched him with an
interest he had never felt before, and nodded assent
when Weil whispered behind his napkin, "Good
material for a novel in that fellow, eh?"</p>

<p>The opportunity for a word alone with Daisy came
earlier than Roseleaf expected. In fact she herself
proposed it, while passing out of the dining room.
She said she had something particular to tell him.</p>

<p>"It is about that money you were so kind as to
say I could have," she explained, when they were far
down the lawn, and out of hearing of the others.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
"I want it very much and very soon. It&mdash;it will be
all right, I hope, and&mdash;and not cause you any inconvenience."</p>

<p>"I will bring it, or send it to-morrow," he replied,
instantly. "But I still wonder what you intend to
do with it."</p>

<p>She smiled archly.</p>

<p>"A good act, I assure you," she replied. "Something
of which you would certainly approve, if you
knew all the circumstances. You are very kind, and
if it was darker here I should be&mdash;almost&mdash;tempted
to kiss you."</p>

<p>He replied that it was growing darker rapidly, and
that the requisite shadow could be obtained if they
stayed out long enough; but she said she could remain
but a few moments, and turned in the direction
of the house.</p>

<p>"But, Daisy!" he cried, and then paused. "You&mdash;you
know there is something of very great importance
that I want to talk about. I get so little chance,
and I want so much to tell you things. I have been
trying to go to your father's office, and I can't find
courage."</p>

<p>"I didn't know you were thinking of buying
wool," she said, mischievously.</p>

<p>"I want one little lamb, to be my own," he
answered, "to love and cherish all my life long.
Am I never to have it?"</p>

<p>She sobered before the earnestness of his sad face.</p>

<p>"You are a dear boy," she said, "and I love you.
There! Don't say anything more to me to-night.
I have made a foolish confession, for which I may
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>yet repent. We must go in. They will be looking
for us."</p>

<p>She looked at his countenance and saw that it was
radiant.</p>

<p>"I can endure anything now," he said. "You
love me, Daisy&mdash;can it be true? I will go in with
you&mdash;and I will wait. But not too long, my sweetheart;
do not make me wait too long. Repent your
confession, indeed! If you do, it will be from no
fault of mine. <i>Daisy!</i>"</p>

<p>As he said these things they were gradually nearing
the piazza, where the negro was taking in the chairs.</p>

<p>"I have something pleasant to tell you," whispered
Daisy. "You don't like Hannibal. Well, he is
going away soon."</p>

<p>Roseleaf assumed surprise.</p>

<p>"Has your father discharged him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"No, he intends to leave of his own accord. He
believes himself fitted for better work. Hush! He
may hear you."</p>

<p>As they passed the servant, Daisy said, "Good-evening,
Hannibal." It was her invariable custom,
and she spoke with the greatest courtesy. But in
this case the negro did not raise his eyes, nor turn
his head toward her, nor make the slightest sign to
show that he heard.</p>

<p>It was too much for Roseleaf, and he stopped.</p>

<p>"Did you hear Miss Daisy address you?" he demanded,
sharply.</p>

<p>Hannibal looked up, with a curious mixture of
amusement, contempt and hate in his dark face.</p>

<p>"I did," he answered.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why did you not answer?"</p>

<p>"Because I did not choose."</p>

<p>Daisy threw herself in front of Roseleaf, just in
time to prevent Hannibal's receiving a blow.</p>

<p>"Oh, stop!" she exclaimed, "I beg you!"</p>

<p>The noise and the sound of raised voices brought
Mr. Fern and his other daughter, with Archie Weil,
to the door. Mr. Fern took in the situation at a
glance, and his troubled face grew more distressed.</p>

<p>"Mr. Roseleaf," he said, speaking as if the words
choked him, "I am surprised&mdash;that you should&mdash;hold
an altercation like this&mdash;in my daughter's
presence."</p>

<p>Roseleaf did not know what to do or say. Daisy's
pleading eyes decided him, much against his judgment,
to drop the matter where it was, galling to his
pride though it might be. He escorted his sweetheart
into the parlor, where the entire party followed,
in a most uncomfortable state of mind.</p>

<p>"How can you permit that negro to insult your
guests?" demanded Millicent, as soon as the door
was closed. "It is beyond belief. If he is master of
this house it is time the rest of us left it. I am certain
Mr. Roseleaf did not act without great provocation."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Fern could answer, Daisy had spoken.</p>

<p>"It is over now, and there is nothing to be said.
Hannibal is going away in a few days, and that will
end your trouble."</p>

<p>The father turned such an incredulous look toward
his daughter that it was evident he had heard nothing
of this.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>"Going?" he echoed, faintly. "Going?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Daisy. "He told me to-day. He is
going to some country where his color will not be
counted a misdemeanor."</p>

<p>Roseleaf had difficulty in maintaining the silence
with which he had determined to encase himself.
But Daisy did not wish him to speak, and her will
was law.</p>

<p>"Well, I am glad of that!" exclaimed Millicent.
"In a country where they consider such people their
equals, he will not meet the pity and consideration
he has so abused here. Still, I do think, father,
that you ought to apologize to Mr. Roseleaf for the
way in which you have addressed him."</p>

<p>This freed the young man's tongue.</p>

<p>"By no means," he said. "Very likely I was
wrong to say anything."</p>

<p>"You were not wrong!" retorted Millicent. "You
were entirely right. You would have been justified
in punishing the fellow as he deserved. It is others
who are wrong. If he were not going, I would
never stay to see repeated what I have witnessed in
the last six months."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern seemed to have lost all ambition for controversy.
His elder daughter's cutting words evidently
hurt, but he would not reply.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil came to the rescue by introducing a new
topic of conversation, that of a European tenor that
was soon expected to startle New York. Daisy went
to the piano, and played softly, talking in whispers
to Roseleaf, who leaned feverishly over her shoulder.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
But she made no allusion to Hannibal, and he did
his best to forget him.</p>

<p>"What do you make of that?" asked Mr. Weil,
when he was in a railway car, on the way back to the
city with his young friend. "A glorious chance for
a novelist to find the reason that black Adonis is
allowed such latitude."</p>

<p>But Roseleaf was not listening. He was thinking
of a sweet voice that had said: "You are a dear
boy and I love you!"</p>

<h3>"LET US HAVE A BETRAYAL."</h3>


<p>Mr. Archie Weil had become quite intimate with
Mr. Wilton Fern; so much so that he called at his
office every few days, took walks with him on business
errands, went with him to lunch (to the annoyance
of Lawrence Gouger, who did not like to eat
alone) and sometimes took the train home with him
at night, on evenings when Shirley Roseleaf was not
of the party. Everybody in the Fern family liked
Archie. Even Hannibal, who had conceived a veritable
hatred for Roseleaf, brightened at the entrance
of Mr. Weil either at the house or office, the
negro seeming to alternate between the two places
very much as he pleased. Millicent liked him because
he was so "facile," as she expressed it; a man with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>whom one could talk without feeling it necessary
to pick each step. Daisy liked him because her
father did, and because Roseleaf did, and because
he treated her with marked politeness that had
apparently no double meaning.</p>

<p>And they all got confidential with him, which was
exactly what he wanted them to do; only the one he
most wanted to give him confidence gave him the
least. This was Mr. Fern, himself.</p>

<p>Try as he might, Archie could not discover what
clouded the brow of the wool merchant, what made
him act like a person who fears each knock at the
door, each sound of a human voice in the hallway of
his office. He could find no reason for Mr. Fern's
attitude toward Hannibal, whose manners were as far
removed as possible from those supposed to belong
to a personal servant. There must be a cause of no
ordinary character when this polished gentleman
permitted a negro to insult him and his daughter, in
a way to excite comment. What it was Mr. Weil
was bent on discovering, but as yet he had made
little progress.</p>

<p>It was on account of this plan that Mr. Weil
affected to like Hannibal so well. He used to spend
hours in devising ways for securing the truth from
that source. Hannibal, however, gave no signs of
intending to reveal his secret, and if he was going
abroad to study, it seemed unlikely that the investigator
would get at many facts in that quarter.</p>

<p>One day, Mr. Weil happened to call at the office of
the merchant at an hour when the latter was out,
and found Hannibal in possession. As this was an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>opportunity seldom available, Archie entered into
a lively conversation with the fellow.</p>

<p>"They tell me you are soon going to leave us," he
said, as a beginning. "I hear that you are going to
Europe."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hannibal, with a certain wariness.</p>

<p>"If I can tell you anything about the country I
shall be glad," said Weil, affably. "I have spent
considerable time there. You don't understand the
language, I believe?"</p>

<p>The negro simply shook his head.</p>

<p>"It's easy enough to acquire. Get right into a
hotel with a lot of students, and pitch in. Though
they <i>do</i> say," added the speaker, archly, "that the
best method is to engage a pretty grisette. The
poet was right:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"'Tis pleasing to be schooled in a strange tongue<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By female eyes and lips; that is, I mean,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When both the teacher and the taught are young&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>"You know the rest."</p>

<p>The answering smile that he expected, did not
come into the negro's face. If possible, it grew still
more reserved and earnest.</p>

<p>"There's one good thing, if you'll excuse my
mentioning it," pursued Archie, "and that is,
the French have no prejudice whatever against color.
Indeed, a colored student gets a little better attention
in Paris than a white one."</p>

<p>Then the silent lips were unlocked.</p>

<p>"Could a black man&mdash;<i>marry</i>&mdash;a white woman, of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>the upper or middle classes?" asked Hannibal,
slowly.</p>

<p>"To be sure. There was the elder Dumas, and a
dozen others. I tell you there's absolutely no color
line there. They judge a man by what he is, not by
the accident of race or skin. You'll see such a difference
you'll be sorry you didn't go years before."</p>

<p>Hannibal sat as if lost in thought.</p>

<p>"Mr. Fern will miss you, though," continued
Archie. "Yes, and the family. You seem almost
indispensable."</p>

<p>A suspicious glance was shot at the speaker, but
his face bore such an ingenuous look that the suggestion
was dismissed. What could he know?</p>

<p>"They will get some one else," said the negro,
quietly.</p>

<p>"Yes, but in these days it is not easy to get people
one can trust. Mr. Fern will not find any one to
take your place in a moment. And just now, when
he evidently has a great deal of trouble on his mind,
it will be unpleasant to make a change."</p>

<p>Hannibal was completely deceived by the apparently
honest character of these observations. He
could not resist the temptation to boast a little, that
peculiar trait of a menial.</p>

<p>"I know all about Mr. Fern's affairs," he agreed.
"Both here and at the house. He would not trust
the next man as he has me."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil nodded wisely.</p>

<p>"I see, I see," he answered. "You know then
what has annoyed him of late&mdash;that which has
puzzled all the rest of us so much. You know, but
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>having the knowledge in a sort of confidential capacity,
you would, of course, have no right to reveal
it."</p>

<p>Hannibal straightened himself up in an exasperating
way.</p>

<p>"You will not find what troubles Mr. Fern," he
said, loftily. "And now, may I ask <i>you</i> something.
Do you expect to marry his eldest daughter?"</p>

<p>An inclination to kick the fellow for his impudence
came so strong upon Mr. Weil that it required all of
his powers to suppress the sentiment. But through
his indignation there struggled his old admiration
for this elegant physical specimen. He wished he
could get a statue modeled from him, before the
original left the country.</p>

<p>"That is a delicate question," he managed to say.</p>

<p>"I know it," replied Hannibal. "But I have observed
some things which may have escaped you.
Shall I tell you what I mean?"</p>

<p>Not at all easy under this strain, the curiosity of
Mr. Weil was so great that he could only reply in
the affirmative.</p>

<p>"Miss Millicent," explained Hannibal, slowly, "is
in love&mdash;very much in love&mdash;with another person."</p>

<p>A stare that could not be concealed answered
him.</p>

<p>"You have not seen anything to indicate it?"
asked the negro. "I thought as much. She has
done her best to cover it, and yet I can swear it is
true. She <i>likes</i> you, as a friend. But she <i>loves</i> him,
passionately."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>He was in for it now and might as well follow this
strange matter to the end.</p>

<p>"Do I know this individual?" asked Archie.</p>

<p>"Yes. You brought him to the house and introduced
him to her."</p>

<p>The man gave a slight cry, in spite of himself.</p>

<p>"Not Roseleaf!"</p>

<p>Hannibal bowed impressively; and at the moment
Mr. Fern's footsteps were heard in the entry.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil did not know, when he tried to think
about it afterwards, whether the wool merchant
noticed particularly that he and Hannibal had been
talking together, or suspected that they might have
confidences. His head was too full of the startling
statement he had heard, and when he was again
upon the street he wandered aimlessly for an hour
trying to reconcile this view with the facts as they
had presented themselves to his mind previously.</p>

<p>Millicent in love with Roseleaf! She had said
very little to the young man, so far as he had observed.
Her younger sister&mdash;sweet little Daisy&mdash;had
monopolized his attention. If it were true,
what an instance it was of the odd qualities in the
feminine mind, that leave men to wonder more and
more of what material it is constructed. But <i>was</i> it
true? Was Hannibal a better judge, a closer student,
than the rest of them? He did not like Millicent,
any better than she liked him. Was he trying
a game of mischief, with some ulterior purpose that
was not apparent on the surface?</p>

<p>Out of it all, Archie Weil emerged, sure of but one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>thing. He must use his eyes. If Millicent loved
Roseleaf, she could not hide it successfully from
him, now that he had this clue.</p>

<p>The girl's novel was selling fairly well. Weil had
made a bargain with Cutt &amp; Slashem that was very
favorable. It gave him an excuse to talk with the
authoress as much as he pleased, and he used his
advantage. He brought her the comments of the
press&mdash;not that they amounted to anything, for it
was evident that most of the critics had merely
skimmed through the pages. He came to tell her
the latest things that Gouger had said, what proportion
of cloth and paper covers were being ordered,
and the other gossip of the printing house. And
now he talked about the work that Shirley was engaged
on, and grew enthusiastic, declaring that the
young man would yet make a place for himself beside
the Stevensons and Weymans.</p>

<p>Millicent struck him as caring much more for
news of her own production than that of the young
man who had been represented as the object of her
adoration. If she was half as fond of Roseleaf as
Hannibal intimated, she was certainly successful in
concealing her sentiments from the shrewd observer.
The result of a fortnight's investigation convinced
Weil that the negro had made a complete mistake,
and all the hypotheses that had arisen were allowed
to dissipate into thin air and fly away.</p>

<p>Another two weeks passed and Hannibal still remained
with the Ferns. An inquiry of Daisy produced
the answer that he thought of remaining in
America till spring. The girl tried to act as if it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>made not the slightest consequence to her whether
he went or stayed, but she did not succeed. Mr.
Weil knew that she wished most heartily for the
time when the negro would take his departure. She
was bound up in her father, and Hannibal was worrying
him to death&mdash;from whatever cause. She
wanted the tie between him and this black man
broken, and hated every day that stood between
them and his hour of sailing.</p>

<p>Roseleaf was almost as uneasy as Daisy over the
delay. He had given her the money she asked for,
though no allusion to its purpose had been made.</p>

<p>She still had it, somewhere, unless she had given
it to the one for whom it was intended. When she
took the package from his hand she rose on her tiptoes
and kissed him with the most affectionate of
gestures. It was the second occasion on which he
had been permitted to touch her lips, and he
appreciated it fully. He realized from her action
how deeply she felt his kindness in providing her
with the funds that were to relieve her father of an
incubus that was sapping his very life.</p>

<p>"You don't find much use for our black Adonis
yet, I see," said Weil, as he laid down the latest
page of the slowly building novel. "I had hoped
you would penetrate the secret of his power over
your heroine's father, by this time."</p>

<p>"No, I cannot understand it at all," replied
Roseleaf. "And if you, with your superior quickness
of perception, have found nothing, I don't see
how you could expect me to."</p>

<p>"You have greater opportunities," said Weil, with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>a smile that was not quite natural. "You have the
ear of the fair Miss Daisy, remember," he explained,
in reply to the inquiring look that was raised to
him.</p>

<p>"Ah, but she knows nothing, either," exclaimed
Roseleaf. "I am sure of that."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil was silent for some moments.</p>

<p>"Well, if you cannot find the true cause," he said,
"you will have to invent a hypothetical one. Your
novel cannot stand still forever. Imagine something&mdash;a
crime, for instance, of which this black
fellow is cognizant. A murder&mdash;that he peeped in
at a keyhole and saw. How would that do?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf turned pale.</p>

<p>"You know," he said, "that you are talking of
impossibilities."</p>

<p>"On the contrary, nothing is impossible," responded
the other, impatiently. "College professors,
delicate ladies, children not yet in their teens,
have committed homicide, why not this handsome
gentleman in the wool business? Or if you <i>won't</i>
have murder&mdash;and I agree that blood is rather tiresome,
it has been overdone so much&mdash;bring a woman
into the case. Let us have a betrayal, a wronged
virgin, and that sort of thing."</p>

<p>The color did not return to the young man's
cheek.</p>

<p>"Which is still more incredible in the present
case," he said. "Do you think Wilton Fern could
do evil to a woman? Look in his face once and
dismiss that libel within the second."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span></p>

<p>A desperate expression crossed the countenance of
the elder man.</p>

<p>"You must agree that he has done something!"
he cried. "He wouldn't allow a darkey to annoy
him like this for fun, would he? He wouldn't wear
that deathly look, and let his child grow thin with
worriment, just as a matter of amusement!"</p>

<p>To this Roseleaf could not formulate a suitable
answer. He felt the force of the suggestions, but
he would not associate crime with the sedate gentleman
who was the object of these suspicions. He
simply could not think of anything disreputable in
connection with Daisy's father, and it seemed almost
as bad to invent an offense for the character in his
novel whose photograph he had thus far taken from
Mr. Fern.</p>

<p>Daisy was surprised, a month after this, to have
Mr. Weil stop her in the hallway, and speak with a
new abruptness.</p>

<p>"Why don't that cursed nigger start for Europe?"
he asked.</p>

<p>She glanced around her with a frightened look.
She feared ears that should not might hear them.
But she rallied as she reflected that Hannibal was
miles away, in fact in the city with her father.</p>

<p>"He is going soon," she replied. "But why do
you allude to him by that harsh term? I thought
you rather liked him."</p>

<p>"I do," he answered. "I like him so well that if
he continues to talk to&mdash;to your father&mdash;as I heard
him the other day, I will throw him into the Hudson:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
I can't stand by and see him insult an&mdash;an old man&mdash;much
longer."</p>

<p>The girl looked at him with sad eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought I had succeeded in silencing that kind
of talk," she said. "Mr. Roseleaf used to speak very
violently of Hannibal, but he has listened to reason
of late. Let me beg you to see nothing and hear
nothing, if you are the friend of this family you have
given us reason to believe."</p>

<p>She extended her hand, as if to ask a promise of
him, but he affected not to see it.</p>

<p>"When does he intend to go?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Before the 1st of April."</p>

<p>"I will give him till that date," he answered, "but
not an hour beyond. He will sail out of this country
for some port or other, or there will be a collision.
You must not, you shall not defend him!" he added,
as she was about to speak. "I know the harm he is
doing, and it must have an end!"</p>

<p>Turning from her suddenly he went out of doors.
Far down the road he stopped to look around, pressing
his hand to his forehead, like one who would
make sure he is awake, and not the victim of some
fearful dream.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<h3>THE GREEN-EYED MONSTER.</h3>


<p>Before the first of April came, Hannibal sailed.
During the winter he had taken lessons in French of
a city teacher, until he believed he could get along
after a fashion with that language. He announced
to Daisy that he would go on the third of March,
then he changed it to the tenth, and again to the
seventeenth. Each time, when the date approached,
he seemed to have a weakening of purpose, a dread
of actually plunging into the tide that set toward
foreign shores. The girl had interviews with him on
each of these occasions, at which what passed was
known only to themselves. And each time, when she
had reached her own room, she threw herself on her
bed and wept bitterly.</p>

<p>But, at last, on the twenty-fourth, he went. With
his overcoat on his arm, his satchel and umbrella in
his hands, he said "Good-by" to the little party that
gathered at the door. He had been treated with
great consideration in that home. Perhaps he realized
this to some extent as he was about to turn his
back upon it. Certain it is that he could not hide
the choking in his throat, as he said the words of
farewell. Archie Weil, who stood there with the rest,
thought he saw a strange look in those black orbs as
they dwelt a moment on the younger daughter; but
it passed so quickly he could not be sure.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Fern was there, and Roseleaf. Millicent had
responded, when a servant went to inform her that
Hannibal was going, that she was very glad. Did
she wish to go down? By no means. She hoped she
was not such a fool.</p>

<p>Weil, who watched everybody, saw an unmistakable
relief in the careworn countenance of Mr. Fern,
when the tall form of his late servant disappeared at
the gate.</p>

<p>"I hope you will do well," had been the last words
of the merchant, and Daisy had added, "So do we
all, I am sure." Roseleaf had not spoken. He had
stood a little apart from the others, his mind filled
with varying emotions. It was he who had furnished
the money to carry out this plan, and if it made one
hour of Daisy's life happier he would be content.</p>

<p>Within an hour it was evident that a cloud had
been lifted from the entire household. Everybody
felt brighter and better. Roseleaf eyed Mr. Fern
with surprise, and had half a mind to go to his office
the next day and tell him how dearly he loved his
daughter. It was the first time anything like a
smile had been upon that face since he had known
its lineaments.</p>

<p>Archie Weil devoted his attention, as usual, to
Millicent. He did not talk to her about Hannibal,
knowing how distasteful was the subject. He discussed
her novel, of which she never seemed to tire,
and asked her about another, which she had begun
to map out. She told him she was sure she could do
better the next time, and spoke of the assistance Mr.
Roseleaf would furnish if needed, quite as if that was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>a matter already arranged between her and the
young novelist.</p>

<p>Archie wondered if Millicent knew the extent of
the attachment that had grown up between Shirley
and her sister. She seemed to feel sure that he
would be at hand when wanted. Could it be that
she believed he would ultimately become her brother-in-law?
The negro's guess had almost been
blotted out of his mind. There had been absolutely
nothing in his observation to confirm it.</p>

<p>A day or two after the departure of Hannibal,
Mr. Fern had a conversation with Daisy, in which
he dwelt with more stress than she could account
for on a special theme. He was talking of Walter
Boggs and Archie Weil, and he cautioned her earnestly
to treat both gentlemen with the greatest consideration.
The girl detected something strange in
his voice, and she stole apprehensive glances at him,
hoping to read the cause in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Why, papa, I never see Mr. Boggs," she said.
"It is weeks and weeks since he came here. As for
Mr. Weil, we all treat him nicely, I am sure, and are
glad to have him come."</p>

<p>"Yes," he admitted. "You use him quite right,
my child. I am not complaining; only, if you could
show him <i>particular</i> attention, something more than
the ordinary&mdash;" He paused, trying to finish what he
wished to say. "There may be a time when he will
be of great value to me&mdash;and&mdash;I want him to feel&mdash;you
observe things so cleverly&mdash;do you think Millicent
cares for him?"</p>

<p>Daisy looked up astonished.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>"Cares&mdash;for&mdash;Mr. Weil?"</p>

<p>Her father nodded.</p>

<p>"He has been here several times a week for months,
and most of his time here has been spent with her.
I thought&mdash;I hoped that she cared for him."</p>

<p>He thought! He hoped! Daisy had never had such
an idea in her head until that moment. She had a
dim idea that her father would give up either of his
daughters with great regret, although she could not
help knowing that the relations between him and
Millicent were not as cordial as those between him
and herself. And he "hoped" that Millie would
marry, and that she would marry Mr. Weil! Her
mind dwelt upon this strange thought. She tried to
find a reason for it. Was there any stronger incentive
in her father's mind than a desire to see Millie
well settled in life, with a good husband?</p>

<p>Had he a fear that the time might soon come
when he could not provide for her?</p>

<p>Or was there a worse fear&mdash;the kind of fear that
had haunted him in relation to Hannibal?</p>

<p>Every time Mr. Weil came to the house after that
the young girl watched him as closely as he had ever
watched her. He did not exchange a word with her
father that did not engage her attention. And the
conclusion she came to was that, whatever the
object of Mr. Fern in this matter, Mr. Weil was
honor itself.</p>

<p>Daisy had never made much of a confidant of
Millicent, and the latter had the habit of keeping her
affairs pretty closely to herself. It was no easy task,
then, that the young sister had in view when she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>came to a decision to talk with Millie about Mr.
Weil.</p>

<p>Her father had expressed a hope that Millie and
Weil would marry. Mr. Fern had some strong
reason for his wish. Whatever it was, Daisy, with
her strong filial love, wanted it gratified.</p>

<p>"Millie, what do you think of marriage?" she
asked, one day, when the opportunity presented
itself.</p>

<p>"I suppose it's the manifest destiny of a woman,"
replied her sister, quietly.</p>

<p>Much encouraged, Daisy proceeded to allude to
Mr. Weil, praising him in the highest terms, and
saying that any girl might be proud to be honored
with his addresses. Millie answered with confirmatory
nods of the head, as if she fully agreed with all
she uttered. But when her sister spoke, the words
struck Daisy like a blow.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear this," she said, in a voice more
tender than usual. "I think Mr. Weil would have
proposed to you long ago, but that he feared the
result."</p>

<p>Daisy gasped for breath.</p>

<p>"Millie!" she cried. "Do you mean that Mr.
Weil&mdash;that&mdash;why, I do not understand! He has
hardly spoken to me, while he has spent nearly every
minute he has been here, with you!"</p>

<p>"Of course he has," responded the other. "What
could be more like a case of true love? If ever a
man lost his head over a woman he has lost his over
you, Daisy. And, at any rate, you must know that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
<i>I</i> care nothing for him. You certainly could see
where <i>my</i> affections were engaged."</p>

<p>Daisy pressed her hand dreamily to her forehead.
She had never known her sister to show the least
partiality to any other man.</p>

<p>"I understand you less than ever," she faltered.</p>

<p>"Are you so blind?" exclaimed Millicent, with
superior wisdom. "Did you think Mr. Roseleaf had
been so closely engaged all this time in my literary
work without learning to care for me? I presume
you will think I ought to blush, but that is not my
way. The strangest thing is that I should have to
explain what I thought every one knew."</p>

<p>Poor little Daisy! She was so crushed by these
statements that she did not know what reply to
make, which way to turn for consolation.</p>

<p>"He has told you that he loves you?" she managed
to articulate.</p>

<p>"He has shown it, at least," was the answer. "He
had not been here a week before he tried to put his
arms around me. I had to let him hold my hand to
avoid an absolute quarrel. He is not an ordinary
man, Daisy, and does not act like others, but we
understand each other. He is waiting for something
better in his business prospects, and as I am
so busy on my new book I am glad to be left to
myself for the present."</p>

<p>It was the old story. Daisy could not doubt her
sister's version of her relations with Mr. Roseleaf.
When he called the next time there was a red spot
in both her cheeks. He told her with happy eyes
that he had at last secured something which made it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>possible to speak to her father. He had been offered
a position on the Pacific Quarterly, at a good salary,
and another periodical had engaged him to write a
series of articles.</p>

<p>"They tell me I have no imagination," he explained,
"but that I do very good work on anything
that contains matters of fact. I have some money
of my own, but I did not want to tell your father I
was an idle fellow, without brains enough to make
myself useful in the world. The novel on which I
base such great hopes might not seem to him worth
considering seriously, you know. So I can go with a
better account of myself, and I am going this very
week."</p>

<p>The bright light that shone from the face at which
she looked made her waver for a moment, but she
found strength to answer that he must not speak to
Mr. Fern about her&mdash;now, or at any other time. She
did not want to marry, or to be engaged. She
wanted to live with her father, and take care of him,
and she wanted nothing else.</p>

<p>"Millie will marry," she added, as a parting
thrust, meant to be very direct and bitter. "One of
us ought to stay with papa."</p>

<p>For a while he was too overwhelmed by her
changed attitude to make a sensible reply. When
it dawned on him that she meant what she said, he
appealed to her to take it back. He could not bear
the thought of giving her up, or even of waiting
much longer for the fulfillment of his hopes. He
spoke in the most passionate tone, and his whole being
seemed wrought up by his earnestness. The
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>girl was constantly thinking, however, that this was
the same way he had addressed Millicent, and that
there was no trust to be placed in him.</p>

<p>"Calm yourself," she said, when he grew violent.
"I have tried to be honest with you. I have thought
of this matter a great deal. You will admit that it
is of some importance to me."</p>

<p>"To you!" he echoed. "Yes, and to me! I do
not care whether I live or die, if I am to lose you!"</p>

<p>She wanted to ask him if he had told Millie the
same thing, but she could not without making an explanation
she did not like to give.</p>

<p>"There are others," was all she said. "Others,
who will make you happier, and be better fitted for
you&mdash;in your career as a writer."</p>

<p>He never thought her allusion had reference to
any particular person, and he answered that there
was no one, there never could be any one, for him,
but her. He had never loved before, he never should
love again. And she listened, thinking what a capacity
for falsehood and tragic acting he had developed.</p>

<p>After two hours of this most disagreeable scene,
Roseleaf left the house, moody and despondent. It
would have taken little at that moment to make
him throw himself into the bosom of the Hudson, or
send a bullet through his brain.</p>

<p>On the way to the station he met Mr. Weil, who
could not help asking what was the matter.</p>

<p>"Oh, it's all up!" he answered. "She has refused
me, and I am going to the devil as quick as I can."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"What are you talking about?" exclaimed the
other, staring at him. "You don't mean&mdash;Daisy!"</p>

<p>"That's just what I mean. I went there to tell
her of my good luck, and to say I was going to ask
her father's consent; and she met me as cold as an
iceberg, and said she had decided not to marry. So
I'm going back to town without a single reason left
for living."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil stood silent and nonplussed for a few
seconds. Then a bright idea came into his head.</p>

<p>"Look here, Mr. Impetuousness," said he. "I
know this can be arranged, and I'm going to see
that it's done. My God, the same thing happens
in half the love affairs the universe over! Give me
a few days to straighten it out. Go home and go
to work, and I'll fix this, I promise you."</p>

<p>It took some time to persuade Roseleaf to follow
this advice, but he yielded at last. Weil pleaded
his warm friendship, begged the young man to do
what he asked if only to please him, and finally succeeded.
A few minutes later Archie had secured an
audience with Daisy.</p>

<p>Too shrewd to risk the danger of plunging directly
into the subject he had in mind, Mr. Weil talked on
almost everything else. It happened that Millicent
was away, which enabled him to devote his attention
to the younger sister without appearing unduly to
seek her. But Daisy, only half listening to what he
said, was pondering the strange revelation her sister
had made, and thinking at each moment that a declaration
of love might be forthcoming.</p>

<p>She remembered her father's injunction to treat
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>this man with particular courtesy, and was in a
quandary what to do in case he came to the crucial
point. But to her surprise, instead of pressing his
own suit, Mr. Weil began to support in a mild manner
the cause of Mr. Roseleaf.</p>

<p>"I met Shirley leaving here," he said, in a sober
tone, "and he was in a dreadful state. You didn't
say anything cross to him, I hope."</p>

<p>With these words there seemed to come to Daisy
a new revelation of the true character of this man.
Loving her himself, he was yet loyal to his friend,
who he believed had a prior claim. As this thought
took root it raised and glorified its object, until
admiration became paramount to all other feelings.</p>

<p>"Why should I be cross to him?" she asked,
evading the point. "There are no relations between
us that would justify me in acting as his
monitor or mentor."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil shook his head.</p>

<p>"He loves you," he said. "You cannot afford,
my child, to trifle with a heart as noble as his."</p>

<p>The expression, "my child," touched the girl
deeply. It had a protective sound, mingled with a
tinge of personal affection.</p>

<p>"I hope you do not think I would trifle with the
feelings of any person," she said. "Still, I cannot
marry every man who may happen to ask me. You
know so much about this matter that I feel justified
in saying this; and I earnestly beg that you will ask
no more."</p>

<p>But this Mr. Weil said gently he could not promise.
He said further that Roseleaf was one of his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>dearest friends, and that he could not without emotion
see him in such distress as he had recently
witnessed.</p>

<p>"You don't know how fond I am of that boy," he
added. "I would do anything in my power to
make him happy. He loves you. He will make
you a good husband. You must give me some message
that will console him."</p>

<p>He could not get it, try as he might; and he said,
with a forced smile, that he should renew the attack
at an early date, for the cause was a righteous one,
that he could not give over unsatisfied. He took her
arm and strolled up and down the veranda, in such
a way that any visitor might have taken them to be
lovers, if not already married. She liked him better
and better. The touch of his sleeve was pleasant.
His low tones soothed the ache in her bosom, severe
enough, God knows! When her father came from
the city he smiled brightly to see them together, and
after hearing that Millicent was away, came to the
dinner table with the gayest air he had worn for
months.</p>

<p>Another week passed, during which Mr. Weil
went nearly every day to Midlands, and communicated
to Roseleaf on each return the result of his
labors, coloring them with the roseate hues of hope,
though there was little that could legitimately be
drawn from the words or actions of Miss Daisy.
The critic for Cutt &amp; Slashem had also been given
more than an inkling of the state of affairs, and had
perused with delight the chapters last written on the
famous romance. He saw that the next experience
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>needed by the author was a severe attack of jealousy,
and as there was no one else to play the part
of Iago he himself undertook the r&ocirc;le.</p>

<p>"Archie Weil is pretty popular with the Fern
family, isn't he?" was the way he began, when he
called on Roseleaf. "I met the old gentleman the
other day and he seemed absolutely 'gone on' him,
as the saying is. They tell me he's out at Midlands
every day. Got his eye on the younger daughter,
too, they intimate."</p>

<p>It takes but little to unnerve a mind already
driven to the verge of distraction. The next time that
Weil saw Roseleaf, the latter received him with a
coolness that could not be ignored. When he
pressed for a reason, the young man broke out into
invective.</p>

<p>"Don't pretend!" he cried. "You've heard of
the case of John Alden. What's been worked once
may go again. I'm not entirely blind."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil, with pained eyes, begged his friend to
explain.</p>

<p>"Tell me this," shouted Roseleaf. "Do you love
that girl, yourself?"</p>

<p>Unprepared for the question, Archie shrank as
from a flash of lightning, and could not reply.</p>

<p>"I know you <i>do</i>!" came the next sentence, sharply.
"And I know that it is owing to the inroads you
have made&mdash;not only with her but with her father&mdash;that
I have been pushed out. Well, go ahead. I've no
objection. Only don't come here every day, with
your cock and bull stories of pleading <i>my</i> cause, for
I've had enough of them!"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>The novelist turned aside, and Mr. Weil, too hurt
to say a word, arose and silently left the room. His
brain whirled so that he was actually giddy. Not
knowing where else to turn he went to see Mr. Gouger,
to whom he unbosomed the result of his call.</p>

<p>"Don't be too serious about it," said Gouger,
soothingly. "It's a good thing for the lad to get
his sluggish blood stirred a little. In a day or two
he'll be all right. That novel of his is coming on
grandly!"</p>

<p>Weil was in no mood to talk about novels, and
finding that he could get no consolation of the kind
he craved, he soon left the office. The critic laughed
silently to himself at the idea of the biter having at
last been bitten, and then took his way to Roseleaf's
rooms.</p>

<p>No answer being returned to his knock, he opened
the door and entered. At first he thought the place
was vacant, but presently he espied a still form on
the bed. The novelist was stretched out in an
attitude which at first suggested death rather than
sleep, and alarmed the visitor not a little. Investigation,
however, showed that he was simply in a
tired sleep, worn out with worry and restless nights.</p>

<p>"What a beauty!" whispered Gouger. "A very
dramatic scene could be worked up if that sweetheart
of his were brought here and made to stand
beside the couch when he awakes. Yes, it would be
grand, but it would need his own pen to trace the
words!"</p>

<p>The hardly dry pages of the great manuscript that
lay on an adjacent desk caught the eyes of the critic,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and he sat down to scan them closer. As he turned
the leaves he grew so delighted as to become almost
uncontrollable.</p>

<p>"He's a genius, nothing less!" he said, rapturously,
and then tiptoed softly from the chamber.</p>

<h3>"I'VE HAD SUCH LUCK!"</h3>


<p>One day Mr. Fern came home in a state of great
excitement. He had not acted naturally for a long
time and Daisy, who met him at the door, wondered
what could be the cause of his strange manner. He
caught his daughter in his arms and kissed her like
a lover. Tears came to his eyes, but they were tears
of joy. He laughed hysterically as he wiped them
away and told her not to mind him, for he was the
happiest man in New York.</p>

<p>"I've had such luck!" he exclaimed, when she
stared at him. "Oh, Daisy, I've had such grand
luck!"</p>

<p>She led him to a seat on a sofa and waited for him
to tell her more.</p>

<p>"You can't imagine the relief I feel," he continued,
when he had caught sufficient breath. "I've had
an awful time in business for years, but to-day everything
is all cleared up. The house over our heads
was mortgaged; the notes I owed Boggs were al<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>most
due; I had given out paper that I could see no
way of meeting. And now it is all provided for, I
am out of financial danger, and I have enough to
quit business and live in ease and comfort with my
family the rest of my days!"</p>

<p>Daisy could only look her surprise. She could
not understand such a transformation. But she
loved her father dearly, and seeing that he was
happy made her happy, too; though she had had
her own sorrows of late.</p>

<p>"Tell me about it, father," she said, putting an
arm around his neck.</p>

<p>"You couldn't understand, no matter how much I
tried to make it clear," he answered, excitedly.
"There was a combination that meant ruin or success,
depending on the cast of a die, as one might
say. Wool has been in a bad way. Congress had
the tariff bill before it. If higher protection was
put on, the stocks in the American market would
rise. If the tariff rate was lowered they would fall.
I took the right side. I bought an immense quantity
of options. The bill passed to-day and the
President signed it. Wool went up, and I am richer
by two hundred and fifty thousand dollars than I
was yesterday!"</p>

<p>For answer the girl kissed him affectionately, and
for a few moments neither of them spoke.</p>

<p>"I don't wonder you say I can't understand business,"
said Daisy, presently. "It would puzzle
most feminine brains, I think, to know how a man
could purchase quantities of wool when he had nothing
to buy with."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>The father drew himself suddenly away from her,
and gazed in a sort of alarm into her wide-opened
eyes.</p>

<p>"That is a secret," he said, hoarsely. "It is one
of the things business men do not talk about. When
stocks are rising it is easy to buy a great deal, if one
only has something to give him a start."</p>

<p>"And you <i>had</i> something?" asked Daisy, trying to
utter the words that she thought would please him
best.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes!" he answered, hurriedly. "I&mdash;had&mdash;something!
And to-morrow I shall free myself of
Boggs, and of&mdash;of all my troubles. I shall pay the
mortgage on the house, and we can have anything
we want. Ah! What a relief it is! What a
relief!"</p>

<p>He panted like a man who had run a race with
wolves and had just time to close the door before
they caught him.</p>

<p>"May I tell Millie?" asked the girl. "She has
worried about the house, fearing it would be sold."</p>

<p>He shook his head as if the subject was disagreeable.</p>

<p>"She will find it out," he said. "There is no
need of haste. And at any rate I don't want you to
give her any particulars. I don't want her to know
how successful I have been. You can say that I
have made money&mdash;enough to free the home. Don't
tell any more than that to any one. It&mdash;it is not a
public matter. I was so full of happiness that I had
to tell you, but no one else is to know."</p>

<p>Daisy promised, though she asked almost imme<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>diately
if the prohibition extended to Mr. Weil. He
was such a friend of the family, she said, he would
be very much gratified.</p>

<p>She had reached thus far in her innocent suggestion,
when she happened to glance at her father's
face. He was deathly pale. His body was limp and
his chin sunken to his breast.</p>

<p>"Father!" she exclaimed. And then, seized with
a nameless fear, was about to summon other help,
when he opened his eyes slowly and touched her
hand with his.</p>

<p>"You are ill! Shall I call the servants?" she
asked, anxiously.</p>

<p>He intimated that she should not, and presently
rallied enough to say he was better, and required
nothing.</p>

<p>"What were we speaking of?" he asked, in a
strained voice.</p>

<p>"We were talking of your grand fortune, and I
asked if I might not tell Mr.&mdash;"</p>

<p>He stopped her with a movement, and another
spasm crossed his face.</p>

<p>"You will make no exception," he whispered.
"None whatever. My affairs will interest no one
else. If you are interrogated, you must know nothing.
Nothing," he added, impressively, "nothing
whatever!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fern's recovery was almost as quick as his
attack, although he did not resume the gaiety of manner
with which he had opened the subject. After
dinner he talked with Daisy, declaring over and over
that she had been on short allowance long enough,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>and asserting that she must be positively in a state
of want. She answered laughingly that she needed
very little, and then suddenly bethought herself of
something and grew sober.</p>

<p>"Do you feel rich enough to let me exercise a
little generosity for others?" she inquired.</p>

<p>He replied with alacrity that she could do exactly
as she pleased with whatever sum he gave her, and
that the amount should be for her to name.</p>

<p>"You don't know how big it will be," she replied,
timidly.</p>

<p>"I'll risk that. Out with it," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"Supposing," she said, slowly, "that I should ask
for a thousand dollars?"</p>

<p>"You would get it," he laughed. "In fact I was
going to propose that you accept several thousand,
and have it put in the bank in your name, so you
would be quite an independent young woman. You
must have your own checkbook and get used to
keeping accounts. I will bring you a certificate of
deposit for three thousand dollars, and each six
months afterwards I will put a thousand more to
your credit, out of which you can take your pin
money."</p>

<p>It seemed too good to be true, and the girl's face
brightened until it shone with a light that the father
thought the most beautiful on earth. Now she could
return the thousand dollars she had borrowed of
Mr. Roseleaf, a sum that had given her much uneasiness
since she broke off her intimate relations with the
young novelist. More than this, she would have <a name="Page_194t" id="Page_194t"></a><a href="#Page_194tn">sufficient</a>
on hand to send the future amounts that Han<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>nibal
would need to keep him abroad. It was such
a strange and delightful thing to see smiles on her
father's face that she did not want anything to disturb
them. She was quite as happy as Mr. Fern, now
that this cloud had been lifted from her mind.</p>

<p>The next day was a bright one for the wool merchant.
By noon he had sent for Walker Boggs and
astonished that gentleman by handing him a check
in full for the entire amount of his indebtedness. In
answer to a question he merely said he had been on
the right side of the market. Mr. Fern also settled
with his mortgage creditor, and went home at night
happy that his head would again lie under a roof
actually as well as in name his own. Notes which he
had given came back to him soon after, and he
burned them with a glee that was almost saturnine.
Burned them, after looking at their faces and backs,
after scanning the endorsements; burned them with
his office door locked, using the flame of a gas-jet for
the purpose.</p>

<p>The ashes lay on the floor, when a knock was
heard and Archie Weil's voice answered to the
resultant question. Mr. Fern lost color at the
familiar sound, but he mustered courage.</p>

<p>"I've come to congratulate you," said Archie,
warmly. "They say you have made a mint of
money out of the rise in wool."</p>

<p>"Who says so?" asked Mr. Fern, warily.</p>

<p>"Everybody. Don't tell me it's not true."</p>

<p>"I've done pretty well," was the evasive reply.
"And I'm going out of business, too. It seems a
good time to quit."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>Mr. Weil made a suitable answer to this statement
and the two men talked together for some time.
After awhile the conversation took a wider turn.</p>

<p>"Where's your young friend, Roseleaf?" asked
Mr. Fern, to whom the matter did not seem to have
occurred before. "I don't believe I have seen him
at Midlands for a month."</p>

<p>"No, he doesn't come," replied Archie, growing
darker. "If you wish a particular reason, you will
have to ask it of your daughter."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern looked as if he did not understand.</p>

<p>"He became very fond of her," explained Archie,
"and for some reason, he does not know what, she
has evinced a sudden dislike to him."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern looked still more astonished.</p>

<p>"Millie is a strange girl," he ventured to remark.
"But I supposed&mdash;I was almost sure, her affections
were engaged elsewhere; and, really, I thought he
knew it."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil stared now, for it was evident his companion
was far from the right road. He was also
interested to hear that Miss Fern had anything like
a love affair in mind, for he had supposed such a
thing quite impossible.</p>

<p>"I was not speaking of Miss Millicent, but of Miss
Daisy," he said.</p>

<p>The wool merchant rose from his chair in the extremity
of his astonishment.</p>

<p>"You meant that&mdash;that Mr. Roseleaf&mdash;was in love
with Daisy!" he said. "And that she seemed to
reciprocate his attachment?"</p>

<p>"I did. And also that a few weeks ago she asked
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>him to cease his visits, giving no explanation of the
cause of her altered demeanor. He is a most excellent
young gentleman," continued Weil, "and
one for whom I entertain a sincere affection. Her
conduct is a great blow to him, especially as he does
not know what he has done to deserve it. I trust
the estrangement will not be permanent, as they are
eminently suited to each other."</p>

<p>The face of Mr. Fern was a study as he heard this
explanation.</p>

<p>"If he was an honorable man, why did he not
come to <i>me</i>?" he asked, pointedly.</p>

<p>"He was constantly seeking Miss Daisy's permission
to do so," replied Archie. "Which she
never seemed quite willing to give him."</p>

<p>"She is too young to think of marriage," mused
Mr. Fern, after a long pause.</p>

<p>"He is willing to wait; but her present attitude,
giving him no hope whatever, has thrown him into
the deepest dejection."</p>

<p>From this Mr. Weil proceeded to tell Mr. Fern all
he knew about Roseleaf. He said the young man
was at present engaged on literary work that
promised to yield him good returns. He had a
small fortune of his own beside. Everything that
could be thought of in his favor was dilated upon to
the fullest extent.</p>

<p>"I don't believe I can spare my 'baby,'" said Mr.
Fern, kindly, "for any man. You plead with much
force, Mr. Weil, for your friend. How is it that <i>you</i>
have never married. Are you blind to the charms
of the sex?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>For an instant Archie was at loss how to reply.</p>

<p>"On the contrary," he said, at last, "I appreciate
them fully. I have had my heart's affair, too; but,"
he paused a long time, "she loved another, and there
was but one woman for me. Perhaps this leads me
to sympathize all the more with my unfortunate
young friend."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern said he would have a talk with Daisy, and
learn what he could without bringing in the name of
his informant.</p>

<p>"We fathers are always the last to see these
things," he added. "It would be terrible to give her
up, but I want her to be happy."</p>

<h3>A BURGLAR IN THE HOUSE.</h3>


<p>Millicent Fern lay wide awake a few nights later,
at Midlands, when the clock struck two. She was
thinking of her second novel, now nearly ready for
Mr. Roseleaf's hand. There was a hitch in the plot
that she could best unravel in the silence. As she
lay there she heard a slight noise, as of some one
moving about. At first she paid little attention to
it, but later she grew curious, for she had never known
the least motion in that house after its occupants
were once abed. She thought of each of them in
succession, and decided that the matter ought to be
investigated.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent had no fear. If there was a burglar
present, she wanted to know. She arose, therefore,
and slipped on a dress and slippers. Guided only
by the uncertain light that came in at the windows,
she tiptoed across the hall, and in the direction in
which she had heard the noise. She soon located
it as being on the lower floor where there were no
bedrooms, and a thrill of excitement passed over her.
She crept as silently as possible down the back
stairs, and toward the sound, which she was now
sure was in the library.</p>

<p>What was the sound? It was the rustling of
papers. It might be made by a mouse, but Millicent
was not even afraid of mice. She was afraid of
nothing, so far as she knew. If there was a robber
there, he would certainly run when discovered. At
the worst she could give a loud outcry, and the servants
would come.</p>

<p>She tiptoed along the lower hall. A man sat at
her father's desk, examining his private papers so
carefully, that he seemed wholly lost in the occupation.</p>

<p>The room was quite light. In fact, the gas was
lit, and the intruder was taking his utmost ease.
His face was half turned toward the girl, and she
recognized him without difficulty.</p>

<p>It was Hannibal!</p>

<p>Hannibal, whom she supposed at that moment in
France!</p>

<p>Without pausing to form any plan, Millicent
stepped into the presence of the negro.</p>

<p>"Thief," she said, sharply, "what do you want?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>They had hated each other cordially for a long
time, and neither had changed their opinion in the
slightest degree. Hannibal looked up quietly at the
figure in the doorway.</p>

<p>"I have a good mind to tell you," he said, smiling.</p>

<p>"You will <i>have</i> to tell me, and give a pretty good
reason, too, if you mean to keep out of the hands of
the police," she retorted. "Come!"</p>

<p>He laughed silently, resting his head on his hands,
his elbows on the desk. Millicent's hair hung in a
loose coil, her shoulders were but imperfectly covered
by her half buttoned gown, the feet that filled
her slippers had no hosiery on them. She was as
fair a sight as one might find in a year.</p>

<p>"Do you remember the time I saw you in this guise
before?" he asked, in a low voice.</p>

<p>A convulsion seized the girl's countenance. She
looked as if she would willingly have killed him, had
she a weapon in her hand. But she could not speak
at first.</p>

<p>"It was you who sought me then," said the
negro. "And because I bade you go back to your
chamber, you never forgave me. Have you forgotten?"</p>

<p>Gasping for breath, like one severely wounded,
Millicent roused herself.</p>

<p>"Will you go," she demanded, hotly, "or shall I
summon help?"</p>

<p>"Neither," replied Hannibal. "If you inform
any person that I am here, I will tell the story I
hinted at just now. Besides, I would only have to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>wait until your father came down, when he would
order them to release me, and say I came here by his
request."</p>

<p>Millicent chafed horribly at his coolness.</p>

<p>"Came here by my father's request!" she echoed.
"In the middle of the night! A likely story. Do
you think any one would believe it?"</p>

<p>"I do not think they would. It would not even
be true. But he would say it was, if I told him to,
and that would answer. Don't you know by this
time that I have Wilton Fern in a vise?"</p>

<p>Yes, she did know it. Everything had pointed in
that direction. Millicent could not dispute the
insinuation.</p>

<p>"What has he done, in God's name, that makes
him the slave of such a thing as you?" she cried.</p>

<p>"I will answer that question by asking another,"
said the negro, after a pause. "Do you know that
Shirley Roseleaf hopes to wed your sister?"</p>

<p>The shot struck home. With pale lips Millicent
found herself trembling before this fellow.</p>

<p>"You love him," pursued the man, relentlessly.
"You do not need to affirm or deny this, for I know.
He loves Daisy, and unless prevented, will marry
her. I hold a secret over your father's head which
can send him to the State prison for twenty years.
If I confide it to you, will you swear to let no one but
him know until I give you leave?"</p>

<p>The girl bowed quickly. She could hardly bear
the strain of delay.</p>

<p>"Then listen," said the negro. "To save himself
in business he has committed numerous forgeries
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>upon the names of two men. One of them is Walker
Boggs and the other Archie Weil. Very recently he
has been successful in his speculations, and has called
in many notes with these forged endorsements. But
the proofs of his crimes are ample, and I possess
them. If he ever proposes to let Roseleaf marry
Daisy, hint to him of what you know, and he will
obey your will. I shall be in the city. Here is my
address. If you need me I am at your service.
Understand, I shall not harm your father unless he
makes it necessary. I only mean to use the fear of
what might await him, and you can do the same. It
is time I was going. I have found all I want here,
though I had enough before."</p>

<p>He handed Millicent a card on which was the
address he had mentioned, and she allowed herself to
take it from his hand. Then he started to pick up a
package of papers that lay where he had put them on
the table, when a third figure, to the consternation of
both, brushed Millicent aside, and stepped into the
room. It was the younger sister.</p>

<p>"Give that to me!" she demanded, imperiously,
reaching out her hand for the package.</p>

<p>The apparition was so unexpected that the previous
occupants of the library stood for a few seconds
staring at it without moving a step. Daisy was
dressed in much the same manner as Millicent, but
she thought only of the danger that threatened one
she loved better than life&mdash;her father.</p>

<p>"Give that to me!" she repeated, approaching
Hannibal closer.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span></p>

<p>Without a word the negro, his head bowed, handed
it to her.</p>

<p>"And now," she said, in the same quick, sharp
tone, "the others!"</p>

<p>"They are not here," he answered, huskily.</p>

<p>"Where are they?"</p>

<p>"At my lodgings in the city."</p>

<p>Instantly Daisy snatched the card from her sister's
hand.</p>

<p>"At this place?" she asked, hastily scanning the
writing.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Hannibal, in a voice that was scarcely
audible.</p>

<p>"I will be there this morning at ten o'clock. See
that they are ready."</p>

<p>The negro bowed, while his chest heaved rapidly.</p>

<p>"And now," said the girl, pointing to the door,
"go!"</p>

<p>He hesitated, as if he wanted to say more to her,
but recollecting that she would meet him so soon, he
turned and obeyed her. At the threshold he only
paused to say, "You must come alone; otherwise it
will be of no use." And she answered that she understood.</p>

<p>She followed some paces behind and closed the
door after him, pushing a bolt that she did not
remember had ever been used before.</p>

<p>Then she turned to encounter her sister; but Millicent
had disappeared.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<h3>BLACK AND WHITE.</h3>


<p>When Daisy reached her own room again, she felt assured
that no one but herself and Millicent knew what
had occurred. This was something. Had her father
awakened, she did not know what might have followed.
She had seen him too often, pale and distraught,
in the presence of his relentless enemy, not
to entertain the greatest thankfulness that he had
slept through this terrible experience. At any cost
it must be kept from him. She would beg, pray, entreat
Millicent to seal her lips. And in the morning
she would go to the address Hannibal had given her
and obtain his proofs of her father's guilt, removing
the frightful nightmare that had so long hung
over that dear head.</p>

<p>Would Hannibal surrender his documents? He
had made a tacit promise to do so, and she had faith
that she could make him keep his word. She knew
the negro had a liking for her that was very strong.</p>

<p>She had made it possible for him to become a
man&mdash;by giving him the money that took him to
France. Why had he returned so suddenly? What
new fancy had caused him to give up his studies and
recross the sea to enter her doors at night, to
plunder still further secrets from her father's private
desk? There were a thousand reasons for fear, but
the devoted daughter only thought of saving the one
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>she loved at all risks. She would dare anything in
his behalf.</p>

<p>And this father of hers&mdash;that she had revered from
babyhood&mdash;was a forger! He had made himself
liable to a term of imprisonment in the common
jail! He was a criminal, for whom the law would
stretch out its hand as soon as his guilt was revealed!
His previous high standing in the community
could not save him; nor the love of his
children; nor his new fortune&mdash;won by such means
as this. Nothing could make his liberty secure but
the silencing of the witness to his fault, the negro
who had carefully possessed himself of certain facts
with which to ruin his benefactor.</p>

<p>What did Hannibal want? Surely he had no revenge
to gratify, as against her or her father! They
had treated him with the greatest consideration.
Only once&mdash;that day on the lawn&mdash;had Daisy spoken
to him in a sharp tone, and then the provocation
was very great. Since then she had raised the money
that was to make a man of him. What did he
require now? An increased bribe to keep him away?
Well, she would get it for him. She would spend
one, two, three thousand dollars if necessary to
purchase his silence; if it needed more she could
borrow of&mdash;of Mr. Weil.</p>

<p>Yes, Mr. Weil was the friend to whom she would
turn in this emergency. He had lost nothing,
apparently, by the unwarranted use of his name.
The notes on which his endorsement had been forged
were all paid. When she met Hannibal she would
ascertain his price and then the rest would be easy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Her father need not even know the danger to which
he had been exposed.</p>

<p>In the morning she went to Millicent's room early,
in order to have a conversation with her undisturbed.
Millicent was sleeping soundly and was awakened
with some difficulty.</p>

<p>"I've only been unconscious a little while," she
said, in explanation. "I thought I never should
sleep again. Oh, what a disgrace! My father a
forger! Liable to go to prison with common
criminals, to wear the stripes of a convict! It seems
as if my degradation could go no lower."</p>

<p>Reddening with surprise at the attitude of her
sister, Daisy answered that the thing to be thought
of now was how to save Mr. Fern from the consequences
of his errors.</p>

<p>"You're a strange girl," was Millicent's reply.
"You don't think of me at all! Won't it be nice to
have people point after me in the street and say,
'There goes one of the Fern girls, whose father is in
Sing Sing!' I never thought I should come to
this. There's no knowing how far it will follow me.
I doubt if any reputable man will marry me, when
the facts are known."</p>

<p>Thoroughly disgusted with her sister's selfishness,
Daisy cried out that the facts must <i>not</i> be known&mdash;that
they must be covered up and kept from the
world, and that she was going to bring this about.
She reminded Millicent of the evident suffering their
father had undergone for the past two years, changed
from a light-hearted man into the easily alarmed
mood they had known so well.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span></p>

<p>"If he deserved punishment, God knows he has
had enough!" she added. "And there is another
thing you and I ought not to forget, Millie. Whatever
he did was in the hope of saving this home and
enough to live on, for us! During the last week he
has had an improvement in business. He has paid
all of those people whose claims distressed him.
You have seen how much brighter it has made him.
Now, when he had a fair prospect of a few happy
days, comes this terrible danger. Surely you and I
will use our utmost endeavors to shield him from
harm. Even if he were the worst of sinners he is
still our father!"</p>

<p>But Millicent did not seem at all convinced. She
could only see that her reputation had been put in
jeopardy, and that a dreadful fear would constantly
hang over her on account of it.</p>

<p>"It is your fault, as much as his, too!" she exclaimed,
angrily. "You both made as much of that
negro as if he were a prince in disguise. I've told
you a hundred times that he ought to be discharged.
I hope you'll admit I was right, at last."</p>

<p>There was little use in reminding her sister that
Hannibal had shown himself the possessor of some
information that endangered Mr. Fern before either
he or Daisy began to cultivate his good will; for she
knew it well enough. What Daisy did say was
more to the point.</p>

<p>"Have you <i>always</i> hated him?" she asked,
meaningly. "What did he mean last night by his
reference to a time when you <i>sought</i> him, <i>en dishabille</i>?"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>

<p>Millicent sprang up in bed, with flashing eyes.</p>

<p>"He is a lying scoundrel!" she cried, vehemently.
"I never did anything of the kind, and I do not see
how you can stand there and repeat such a calumny!"</p>

<p>"The strange thing about it," replied Daisy, quietly,
"is that you did not dispute him. But then, you did
not know a third person was present. When I meet
him this morning I shall ask for further particulars."</p>

<p>Millicent sprang from the bed and threw herself
at her sister's feet.</p>

<p>"Would you drive me mad!" she exclaimed. "I
am distracted already with the troubles of this house,
and now you wish to hear the lying inventions of one
you know to be a blackmailer and a robber! Don't
mention my name to him, I entreat you. He is capable
of any slander. You can't intend to listen to
tales about your sister from such a low, base thing!"</p>

<p>Having Millicent at her feet, Daisy was pleased to
relent a little.</p>

<p>"Very well," she said. "I will not let him tell
me anything about you. But I want you to promise
in return that you will do all you can to protect
father from the slightest knowledge of what happened
last night. I am afraid it would kill him. So
far he believes us ignorant of his troubles. If I can
make an arrangement to send Hannibal back to
France he will remain so. Be sure you do not
arouse his suspicions in any way, and we may come
out all right yet."</p>

<p>The promise was made, and, as nothing could be
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>gained by prolonging the conversation, Daisy withdrew.
In the lower hall she met her father, and his
bright smile proved to her that he was still in blissful
ignorance that any new cloud had crossed his
sky. Millicent did not appear at breakfast, for
which neither of the others were sorry. It enabled
Mr. Fern to talk over some of his plans with his
younger daughter. Among them was a possible
trip abroad, for he said he felt the need of a long
rest after his troubled business career.</p>

<p>The last suggestion opened a new hope for Daisy.
If worse came to worst, and there was no other way
to escape the jail, flight in a European steamer
could be resorted to. It would mean expatriation
for life, as far as he was concerned, but that would
be a thousand times better than a lingering death
inside of stone walls. He could raise a large sum
of ready money, and they would want for nothing.
Millie would not wish to go with them, probably.
She would stay and marry&mdash;how the thought
choked Daisy&mdash;marry Mr. Roseleaf; unless indeed,
the young novelist did what she had foreshadowed,
repudiated the thought of allying himself with a
tainted name.</p>

<p>Roseleaf! The bright, happy love she had given
him came back to the child like a wave of agony.</p>

<p>Making an excuse that she had shopping to do,
Daisy took the train to the city with her father, and
parted from him at a point where the downtown and
uptown street cars separated. Then she took a cab
and drove to the address given her.</p>

<p>It was not the finest quarter in the city, and she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>would have hesitated at any other time before taking
such a risk as going there alone. At present she
thought of nothing but the object of her visit. Inquiry
at the door brought the information that the
lady was expected and that she was to go upstairs
and wait. The woman who let her in was a pleasant
faced mullatress, and several young children of
varying shades were playing on the stairs she had
to ascend. Daisy mounted to the room designated,
which proved to be a small parlor, with an alcove,
behind the curtains of which was presumably a
bed.</p>

<p>As the weather was quite warm, the girl went to
the front windows and opened them, in order to
admit the fresh air. Then she sat down and waited
impatiently. There was a scent in the room which
she associated with the Ethiopian race, a subtle
aroma that she found decidedly unpleasant. It
gave her an indefinable uneasiness, and she mentally
remarked that she would be glad when the
ordeal was over. Her nerves were already beginning
to suffer.</p>

<p>After the lapse of fifteen minutes, Hannibal entered.
He had the look of one who had passed a
sleepless night, and despite the blackness of his
complexion, his cheeks seemed pale.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," said Daisy, rising.</p>

<p>"Good-morning," he replied.</p>

<p>And then there was a brief space of silence, each
waiting for the other.</p>

<p>"I am here, you see," said the girl, finally, with an
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>attempt at a smile. "And now will you give me the
things I came for, as I cannot stay long?"</p>

<p>The negro tried to look at her, tried many times,
but failed. His eyes shifted uneasily to all the other
objects in the room, resting on none of them more
than a second at a time.</p>

<p>"You wonder," he said, after another pause, "why
I returned to America, why I came to your house
last night. I thought I could tell you&mdash;this morning&mdash;and
I have been trying to prepare myself to do
so&mdash;but I cannot. You blame me a great deal, that
is evident in every line of your face, but you do not
know what I have suffered. Were your father to go
to jail for the term the law prescribes, he would not
endure the agony that has been mine."</p>

<p>He looked every word he spoke and more.</p>

<p>"I am sorry, truly sorry for you," she replied.
"But why could you not leave all your troubles,
when you went to France, and begin an entirely new
life? You found it true what I told you, I am sure,
about the lack of prejudice&mdash;on account of your&mdash;race."</p>

<p>He nodded and cleared his throat before he spoke
again.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; but it is not the prejudice <i>there</i> that
worries me. It is the prejudice <i>here</i>. It is the
barrier my color brings between me and the only
being whose regard I crave!"</p>

<p>The girl's cheeks grew rosier than ever, but she
affected not to understand, and once more reverted
to the errand that had brought her thither.</p>

<p>"You promised me the documents with which my
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>poor father has been tortured," she said, reproachfully;
"let us not talk of other things until you
have given them to me."</p>

<p>The negro drew from a pocket of his coat a fair-sized
package tied with a ribbon.</p>

<p>"They are all there," he said. "Every scrap,
every particle of proof, everything that could bring
the breath of suspicion upon your father's honesty.
All there, in that little envelope."</p>

<p>She reached for it, but instead of giving it to her,
Hannibal caught her hand, and before she dreamed
what he intended, pressed a kiss upon it. The next
moment the girl, with a look of outraged womanhood,
was rubbing the spot with her handkerchief, as
if he had covered it with poison.</p>

<p>"You brute!" she exclaimed. "You&mdash;you&mdash;"</p>

<p>She could not find the word she wanted; nothing
in the language she spoke seemed detestable enough
to fill the measure of her wrong.</p>

<p>"You see!" he answered, bitterly. "Because I
am black I cannot touch the hand of a woman that is
white. You have claimed to be without the hatred
of the African so ingrained among Americans; you
have talked about the Almighty making of one
blood all the nations of the earth; and yet you are
like the rest! A viper's bite could not have aroused
deeper disgust in you than my lips. And all because
the sun shone more vertically on my ancestors than
it did on yours!"</p>

<p>Daisy was divided between her horror of the act
he had committed and her anxiety to do something
to free her father from his danger. She suppressed
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>the hateful epithets that rose to her tongue and once
more entreated the negro to give her the packet he
held in his possession.</p>

<p>"You can do nothing with it but injure a man
who has been kind to you," she pleaded. "And if
you use the information you have, and afterwards
repent, it will be too late to remedy your error. Give
it to me, and return to France with the proud consciousness
that you are worthy the position you
wish to occupy."</p>

<p>Hannibal shook his head with decision.</p>

<p>"That would be very well if I ever could be considered
a man by the one for whose opinion I care
most. But while I am to her a creature something
below the ape, a mere crawling viper whose touch
is pollution, I will act like the thing she thinks me.
To-day I possess the power to make a high-born
gentleman dance whenever I pull the string. You
ask me to give up this power, and in return you
offer&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>"One would suppose," remarked Daisy, struggling
with herself in this dilemma, "that the ability
to inflict pain was one a true nature would delight
to surrender. My father has done no harm to
you."</p>

<p>The negro bent toward her and spoke with vehemence.</p>

<p>"But his daughter has! She has made my life
wretched. Whatever position I may attain will
be worthless to me, without the love I had hoped
might be mine."</p>

<p>"<i>Love!</i>" cried the girl, recoiling. "<i>Love!</i>"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span></p>

<p>"Love and marriage," he replied. "In France we
could live without the hateful prejudices that prevail
in America. I have natural ability enough, you have
told me so a thousand times, and I could make myself
worthy of you. As my wife&mdash;"</p>

<p>Daisy rose and interrupted him fiercely.</p>

<p>"Cease!" she exclaimed. "There is a limit to
what I can endure. If you mean to make any promise
of that kind a prelude to my father's freedom
from persecution, we may as well end this conversation
now as later. He would rather rot in prison
than have his child sacrifice herself in such a manner!"</p>

<p>She started toward the door, and he did not interrupt
her passage, as she half expected he would do;
but he spoke again.</p>

<p>"All this because I am black," he said.</p>

<p>"Because you are a cruel, heartless wretch!" she
answered, her eyes flashing. "Because you have
abused the goodwill of a generous family; because
you have tortured a kind old man and a loving daughter.
If you were as white as any person on earth, I
would not marry you. Worse than all outward
semblance is a dark and vile mind. Do what you
like! I defy you!"</p>

<p>The door opened and closed behind her. Hannibal
heard her retreating footsteps grow fainter on
the stairs, and then there was silence.</p>

<p>"I might have known it," he said, aloud. "I did
know it, but I kept hoping against hope. She would
wed a Newfoundland dog sooner than me. Nothing
is left but to make her repent her action. I will
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>bring that father of hers to the dust, if only to
revenge the long list of injuries his race has inflicted
on mine!"</p>

<h3>"PLAY OUT YOUR FARCE."</h3>


<p>When Daisy left the house where she had the
interview with Hannibal, she walked for some
minutes aimlessly along the street. Her mind was
in a state of great excitement. She realized that she
had defied a man who could inflict the deepest injury
on the father she dearly loved. How she could have
done otherwise was not at all clear, but the terror
which hung over her was none the less keen. The
proposal of the negro&mdash;to marry her&mdash;filled her with a
nameless dread that made her teeth chatter, though
it was a warm day. Rather would she have cast her
body into the tides that wash the shores of Manhattan
Island. Even to save her father from prison&mdash;if
it came to that&mdash;she could not make this sacrifice.
She now felt for Hannibal a horrible detestation,
a feeling akin to that she might entertain for a
rattlesnake. Whatever good she had seen in him in
other days had vanished under the revelations of his
true character.</p>

<p>What to do next was the absorbing question. A
great danger hung over her father. A dim idea of
seeking the mayor&mdash;or the chief of police&mdash;and im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>ploring
their mercy, entered her brain. Then she
thought of Roseleaf, whose aid she might have
secured, if he had not proved himself a double-dealer,
capable of making love to herself and Millicent
at the same time. And then came the resolve
to seek out Mr. Weil, the one person in all this
trouble that seemed clear of wrong. Her sister had
told her that he loved her. Well, if necessary she
would marry him. At least he was a man of honor,
and white. Yes, she would go to him and throw
herself upon his mercy.</p>

<p>Daisy knew that Archie made his headquarters at
the Hoffman House, and summoning a cab she asked
to be taken to that hotel. Ensconced in the ladies'
parlor she awaited the coming of the man she wanted
and yet dreaded so much to see. Luckily he was in
the house, and in a few moments responded in person
to her card.</p>

<p>"Why, Miss Daisy," he stammered. "What is
the matter? Nothing wrong, I trust. You look
quite pale. Is it anything&mdash;about&mdash;your father?"</p>

<p>The girl was pale indeed. Now that Mr. Weil
was so close, the danger that he might not be willing
to help her rose like a mountain in her path. She
did not know exactly how grave a matter forgery
was&mdash;whether it was something that the injured
party would be able or likely to forgive. If she
should tell him everything, and he should refuse to
be placated&mdash;what could she do then?</p>

<p>There was no one else in the parlor, but seeing
that she wanted as much seclusion as possible, Mr.
Weil motioned the girl to follow him to a remote
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>corner, where the curtains of a recessed window
partially concealed them. He felt that she had
come on a momentous errand. His suspicions concerning
Mr. Fern were apparently about to be verified,
and if so, he did not mean that other ears should
hear the tale.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weil," began Daisy, tremblingly, "I don't
know what to say to you. I am in great distress.
Would you&mdash;will you&mdash;help me?"</p>

<p>He responded gently that he would do anything
in his power. He bade her calm herself, and promised
to be the most attentive of listeners.</p>

<p>Reassured by his kind words and manner, the girl
began again; but she could not tell her story connectedly,
and after making several attempts to do
so, she broke out in a new direction.</p>

<p>"I want so very much of you, dear Mr. Weil. And
I am nervous and afraid to ask what I would like. I
will give you anything you please in return. Yes,
yes, anything."</p>

<p>He smiled down upon her face, on which the tears
were making stains in spite of her.</p>

<p>"You are promising a great deal, little girl," he
said.</p>

<p>"I know it; I realize it fully," she responded
quickly. "But I mean all I say. I did not think I
could, once, but I am quite resolved now. Millie
told me you were in love with me, and feared I would
refuse you. But I won't. No, no, I will marry you&mdash;indeed
I will&mdash;if you will only save my darling
father!"</p>

<p>The concluding words were spoken in the midst of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>a torrent of sobs that shook the girlish frame and
affected powerfully the strong man that witnessed
them.</p>

<p>"Daisy, dear child, don't speak like this," he answered.
"If I can do anything for your father I will
most gladly, and the price of your sweet little heart
shall not be demanded in payment, either. Leave
that matter entirely out of the question, and tell me
at once what you desire."</p>

<p>She heard him with infinite delight, and wiping her
eyes she began, in broken tones, to relate the history
of Hannibal's revelations. As she proceeded his
brow darkened, and when she had finished he muttered
something that sounded very much like a
curse.</p>

<p>"And what do you wish of me?" he asked, when
she had ended.</p>

<p>"To keep him from having my father put in prison;
to give us time to escape, if there is no other way;
and to forgive the harm to yourself. I know," she
added earnestly, "it is a great deal to ask, but I have
no one else to go to. He has paid every cent, and
you will lose nothing. Tell me, dear Mr. Weil, is
there anything you can do?"</p>

<p>He had the greatest struggle of his life to keep
from bending over that trembling mouth and pressing
upon it the kiss he knew she would not refuse;
that mouth he had coveted so long and which must
never be touched by his lips!</p>

<p>"Can I do anything?" he repeated. "Certainly.
I can stop that fellow so quickly he won't know what
ails him. Have no fear Miss Daisy. Go home and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>rest in peace. Before the sun sets I will remove the
last particle of danger from your father's path."</p>

<p>The girl sprang to her feet and would have thrown
her arms around his neck had he not prevented her.</p>

<p>"You are certain you can do this?" she cried,
beaming with happy eyes upon him.</p>

<p>"There is not the least question of it. But&mdash;I
must demand payment for my trouble. I shall not
do this work for nothing."</p>

<p>With a hot blush Daisy lowered her eyes to the
carpet.</p>

<p>"I have already told you what I will do," she said,
trembling. "If you accomplish what you say, have
no fear but I shall keep my word."</p>

<p>There was an element of pride and truth in the way
she spoke that struck the hearer strongly. The reverent
smile on his face grew yet deeper.</p>

<p>"I am placed in a peculiar situation," he said,
after a slight pause. "Your sister has, unintentionally,
no doubt, misrepresented matters in a way that
may be embarrassing for us both. When I have removed
the troubles that stand in your way, I will
talk this over with you."</p>

<p>Daisy looked up quickly. What could he mean?</p>

<p>"I beg you to explain," she stammered. "If
there has been any mistake no time can be better to
set it right than now."</p>

<p>The man toyed with the lace of the window curtain.
He had no intention of evading his duty, and
yet he did not find it agreeable as he proceeded.</p>

<p>"Your sister told me," he said, finally, "that&mdash;you
loved me. She was wrong. I knew all the time she
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>was wrong. You have just offered to give yourself
to me in marriage in exchange for the efforts that I
am to make on your father's behalf. But I would
not marry a woman who did not love me&mdash;who only
became mine from gratitude. No, I could not
accept you under such circumstances."</p>

<p>The young girl glanced at him timidly.</p>

<p>"I wish you knew how much I liked you," she
said. "I never knew a man I respected more."</p>

<p>"That is most gratifying," he answered, "for I
hold your good opinion very highly. You must
think I speak in riddles, for I have said that I
demand payment for my services, and yet that I
would not accept the greatest gift it is in your
power to bestow upon me. Let me wait no longer
in my explanation. When I have put your father
out of all danger from this blackmailer&mdash;and I can
easily do it, never fear&mdash;you must do justice to
Shirley Roseleaf."</p>

<p>She shivered at the name, as if the east wind blew
upon her.</p>

<p>"He is not a true man," she replied, in a whisper.
"He has forfeited all claim to my consideration."</p>

<p>"Why do you say that? I am afraid there is
another misunderstanding here, my child."</p>

<p>Then he drew out of her, slowly at first, the revelations
that Millicent had made. And he disposed of
the charges, one by one, until there was nothing
left of them.</p>

<p>"Could you&mdash;would you&mdash;only go with me to his
rooms," he added, "and see him lying there, wan
and pale, disheartened at the present, hopeless for
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>the future, you would change your mind. He has
never in his life loved but one woman, and that one
is yourself. I will not undertake to say why you
have been told differently, though I could guess.
Shirley Roseleaf loves you, Miss Daisy, and you love
him. When I have made good my promise, I shall
ask you to come to my friend's side and bring him
back to health with the sunshine of your presence."</p>

<p>Daisy was more than half convinced, for the
strong affection she had had for the young man
plead for him in every drop of her blood.</p>

<p>"Is he so very ill?" she asked, dreamily.</p>

<p>"He has not left his room for a week," was the
answer. "Nothing his friends can say will move
him. He is in such a state of mind that he even refuses
to have me with him; me, until very lately,
his closest friend. But if I tell him you have relented,
there is no medicine on earth will have such
an instant effect."</p>

<p>The girl thought for some moments without speaking.</p>

<p>"It is my father first, of course," she said at last.
"But while you are arranging matters concerning
him, I do not see any reason to keep me from helping
a sick boy. I&mdash;yes, I will go with you now."</p>

<p>He looked the gratitude he could not speak, and
fearful that in her mercurial mood she might change
her mind, he accompanied her without delay to the
street, and procured a cab, in which they were
driven rapidly to Roseleaf's lodgings. On the way,
with that loved form so near him, Archie Weil had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>a constant struggle. She might be his, if he would
forget duty.</p>

<p>And he loved her! God, how he loved her! He
could marry her, and perhaps after a fashion make
her happy. The perspiration stood on his forehead
as he dwelt on the bliss that he had resolutely cast
aside.</p>

<p>Roseleaf's landlady came to the door in person
and informed the callers that her guest was in about
the same condition as he had been for some days.
He was not ill in bed, but he did not leave his
room. When she sent up his meals he received them
mechanically, and they were often untouched when
the domestic went for the dishes. He wrote several
hours a day, though he was undoubtedly feeble.
Did he have any visitors? Only one, Mr. Gouger,
who was with him at the present moment. Should
she go up and announce them? Very well, if it was
not necessary. Mr. Weil could show the lady into
the adjoining room, which was empty, until he had
announced her presence in the house to his friend.</p>

<p>Archie whispered to Daisy when he left her at
Roseleaf's door, that he would come for her as soon
as possible. He did not enter the sick boy's chamber
at once, for something in the conversation that
came to his ears arrested his steps at the threshold.
Mr. Gouger's voice was heard, and Archie's ears
caught the sound of his own name.</p>

<p>"You should let me send to Mr. Weil," said Gouger.
"I am sure he can explain everything. You
have written all you ought for the present. He
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>would take you to ride and bring the color to those
white cheeks of yours."</p>

<p>"But he cannot bring me the girl I love," responded
Roseleaf, with a profound sigh. "Even if
I have done him injustice, she is lost to me now.
You know appearances were against him. Why,
you agreed with me about it. I don't want to see
any one. I want to go away from here, and forget
my sorrows as best I can in some far distant place."</p>

<p>There was a sadness in the tone that went to the
listener's heart. The door was slightly ajar and
Archie took the liberty of looking into the room.
Roseleaf lay stretched out in a great chair, and Gouger
leaned over him, appearing for all the world
like some sinister bird of prey. Mr. Weil felt for
the first time in his life that there was something uncanny
in the aspect of the book reviewer. He did
not think he could ever be close friends with him
again. And what did Shirley mean by saying that
Lawrence had "agreed" with him when he heard
such base opinions?</p>

<p>The critic was fingering with apparent satisfaction
a pile of MSS. that lay on the table. It had grown
vastly since Archie saw it the last time, and must be
fifteen or twenty chapters in extent now.</p>

<p>"You must not go away until you have finished
this wonderful work," replied Gouger, with concern.
"A few more months&mdash;a little further experience in
life&mdash;and your reputation will be made! Ah, it is
wonderful! It is magnificent! The world will ring
with your praises before the year is ended. Such
fidelity to nature! Such perfection of detail! In
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>all my career I have never seen anything to approach
it!"</p>

<p>Shirley moved uneasily in his chair.</p>

<p>"Do you ever think at what cost I have done this?"
he asked. "I know the pain of a burn because I
have held my hands in the fire. I know the agony
of asphyxiation, because I have dangled at the end
of a rope. I can write of the miner buried beneath
a hundred feet of clay, because I have had the load
fall on my own head. To love and find myself beloved;
then to see happiness snatched without explanation
from my grasp; to feel that my best friend
has been the one to betray me! That is what I
have passed through, and from the drops of misery
thus distilled, I have penned those lines you so much
admire. I have written all I can of these horrors.
I will not begin again till I have caught somewhere
in the great sky a glimpse of sunlight!"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil could wait no longer. He pushed open
the door and went to the speaker's side.</p>

<p>"The sunlight is awaiting you," he said, gazing
down upon the figure in the armchair. "You have
only to raise your curtain."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger sprang up in astonishment at the sudden
arrival, and perhaps a little in alarm also; for
he could not tell how long the visitor had been
eavesdropping at the portal. But Roseleaf turned
his languid eyes toward his old friend, and was
silent.</p>

<p>"Shirley, my boy," pursued Weil, with the utmost
earnestness, "I can prove to you now that Daisy
Fern loves you and you alone."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>Roseleaf did not move. His lips opened and the
words came stiffly.</p>

<p>"You can promise many things," he said, "but can
you fulfill any of them?"</p>

<p>So cold, so unlike himself!</p>

<p>"What will convince you?" demanded Weil.
"Shall I bring a letter from her? Or would you
rather she came in person, to tell you I speak the
truth?"</p>

<p>The shadow of a smile, a smile that was not agreeable,
hovered around the corners of the pale mouth.</p>

<p>"I shall write no more," said the lips, when they
opened, "until I have seen her and heard the reason
for my rejection. I will discover who my enemy is.
I will unmask the man or the woman that has done
me this injury. Till then, I shall write no more.
No, not one line."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger was nonplussed by the new turn in
affairs. He knew that Weil had some basis for what
he said, that he was not the man to come with pretence
on his tongue. Neither of the other persons
in the room paid the least attention to him, any more
than if he had not been present. It was like a play,
at which Gouger was the only spectator.</p>

<p>"Could you bear it if I brought her to you to-day, if
I brought her here now?" asked Archie, beseechingly.
"If I go and get her, and she comes with me, will
the shock harm you?"</p>

<p>The ironical smile deepened on the face of the
younger man.</p>

<p>"Play out your farce," he said.</p>

<p>Casting one look of apprehension at Roseleaf, Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
Weil turned toward the door that entered the hallway.
Before he could reach it, a female form came
into the room and caught his arm. Together they
faced the recumbent figure in the chair. This lasted
but a moment. Then Daisy broke from her escort
and threw herself at her lover's feet.</p>

<p>"Come," whispered Archie, to the critic. "Let
us leave them alone."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX.</h2>

<h3>LIKE A STUCK PIG.</h3>


<p>Hannibal was neither better nor worse, morally,
because his color was black. There are men with
white complexions who would have done exactly as
he did. There are others as dark as Erebus who
would have done nothing of the sort.</p>

<p>He was no ordinary negro. His intelligence was
above the average. When he first entered the employ
of Mr. Fern, that gentleman took every pains to encourage
the aptitude for learning that he found in
him. Hannibal accompanied his employer to his
office, where he was entrusted with important commissions,
which he seemed for a long time to execute
with faithfulness and discrimination. At home he
performed his duties in a way that gave great satisfaction.
At the end of the first six months Mr. Fern
would have hated to part with a servant that he
believed difficult to replace.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span></p>

<p>But the great source of trouble arose gradually.
Hannibal began to entertain a sentiment for his master's
younger daughter that was impossible of fruition.
Daisy treated him in the most considerate
manner, never dreaming what was going on behind
his serious brow. Millicent, ungovernable in all
things, began early to show the bitterest enmity
toward the negro, while her sister, seeing that her
father liked and appreciated him, tried by her own
kindness to compensate for the other's rudeness.
What caused Millicent's feelings Daisy had no means
of knowing, and she had not the least suspicion until
she heard the conversation in the library the night
the house was entered. Even then she did not take
the subject much to heart, for she did not comprehend
all that Hannibal had meant to convey in the
brief and sarcastic expression he used. Daisy had a
mind too pure to believe anything so heinous of her
own sister as Hannibal had intimated.</p>

<p>The passion of love is a thing that grows in curious
ways. What made it seem to Hannibal that
there was hope for him was the discovery that Mr.
Fern was committing forgeries and that the proofs
might be his for the taking. If he could hold such
a power as that over this gentleman, who could say
that even so great a m&eacute;salliance as his daughter's
marriage to an African might not be arranged?</p>

<p>The negro proceeded cautiously. He secured the
proofs he wished, and let Mr. Fern know tacitly that
he had them. The terror, the undisguised fear that
followed, the admittance of the menial to a totally
different position in the household and the office,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>showed that the servant had not underrated the importance
of his acquisition.</p>

<p>Not one word bearing directly on the subject
passed between them. The condition of the merchant
was more horrible than it would have been
had his employ&eacute; said outright, "I have the proof
that you are a forger&mdash;I can send you to prison for
twenty years, and I will do so unless you do so-and-so
for me." He did not know how Hannibal meant
to use his information. He was afraid to broach the
matter to him. He could only wait and suffer; and
suffer he did, as a proud-spirited, high-minded man
who has made an error must suffer, when such a
sword hangs over his head, ready at any moment to
fall.</p>

<p>As Walker Boggs had said, Mr. Fern was not by
nature a business man. After the former's retirement
from active participation in the concern there
was a series of losses. When Mr. Fern took his pen
and began to imitate the signature of his late partner
on a sheet of paper, nothing but some such
course stood between him and bankruptcy. He felt
certain that if he could tide over twenty-four hours
he would be saved. Before he left his office he had
made a note, written Mr. Boggs name across the
back of it, and raised money thereon.</p>

<p>He did this many times afterwards, but finally,
when he again wanted a name to save himself with, he
dared not use this one. Boggs had called in to remark
that he should withdraw the capital he had lent as
soon as the term arranged for had expired. The
sum was already infringed upon, had the investor
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>known it. The next name used was that of Archie
Weil. Archie had been to the house a good deal to
see Millicent. Mr. Fern believed there was a love
affair between them, and he caught at the straw of
possible protection in case of discovery. The forgeries
became numerous, and the total amount on
that day when the passage of a new tariff saved the
venturesome speculator, was very large. Hannibal
was at this time in foreign parts, or at least so the
merchant supposed. He soothed his conscience with
the reflection that this additional wrong act would
enable him to right the others that preceded it. And
things might have gone well had not the negro returned,
consumed with the love he bore the younger
daughter, and had not his love turned to vinegar by
her contemptuous rejection of his advances.</p>

<p>An hour after Daisy left him, Hannibal had made
up his mind to be revenged. He had faltered a little
in the meantime, asking himself what good it would
do to bring disgrace on the head of this poor old
man, but his injuries were too strong for mercy.
He was despised by them all; he would show them
that, black as he was, his ability to hurt was no less
strong than theirs. Roseleaf had made the first impression
on that young heart he himself had craved.
It remained to be seen whether he would wed the
daughter of a convict. There would be something
pleasant, too, in disgracing Millicent, who had once
placed herself in a position where he could have
blasted her reputation forever, and had afterwards
dared to treat him as if he were the dirt beneath her
shoes. Yes, Hannibal decided, he would go to Mr.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
Weil and Mr. Boggs, and show them the way this
man had used their names, hawking them in the
public market without their knowledge.</p>

<p>When Hannibal reached the Hoffman House and
inquired for Mr. Weil, he was told that he was
absent. An hour later he received the same answer.
A visit to the residence of Mr. Boggs elicited a
reply precisely similar. In fact, the day wore away
and evening arrived before he found them.</p>

<p>In the meantime, Mr. Weil had not been idle.
While Daisy and Shirley Roseleaf were tearfully exchanging
their explanations, he sent a messenger to
Mr. Boggs, asking that gentleman to come to him
without delay. An hour later the messenger arrived
with the gentleman, and having engaged a room for
temporary use, and seen to it that Roseleaf wanted
nothing at present but his fair nurse, Archie pulled
Boggs in and locked the door securely.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" exclaimed Boggs. "You look
and act as if there was the devil to pay."</p>

<p>"There is," was the short answer. "I want you
to do one of the most creditable acts of your life. I
want it as a personal favor, and I'm going to have it,
too."</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs crossed his hands over his paunch and
waited for further information.</p>

<p>"Are you a first-class liar?" was Mr. Weil's next
question. "Could you, in an emergency, do yourself
justice as an eminent prevaricator? Are you
able, for a certain time, to banish truth from your
vicinity?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs remarked, in response to these astonish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>ing
suggestions, that he could tell much better what
his friend was about if he would drop metaphor.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil hesitated. He saw no way but to trust
this man with the facts, and yet he dreaded the possibility
that he might prove obstinate.</p>

<p>"By-the-way," he said, as if to change the subject
temporarily, "have you been out to see Fern
lately?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs shook his head.</p>

<p>"You ought to," said Weil. "He's improved a
thousand per cent. in the last few weeks. His financial
luck has made a new man of him."</p>

<p>"I'm glad of that," responded the other. "And
I'm glad too that I've got my money out of his firm,
for I had a strong suspicion at one time that he was
running pretty close to the wall."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil nodded to show that he believed this
statement, and then grew sober.</p>

<p>"Sometimes, when men get into a tight place
financially," he said, "they do queer things. Supposing
I should tell you that Mr. Fern had endorsed
checks and notes in a way he was not authorized
to do?"</p>

<p>The stout man opened his eyes wider.</p>

<p>"That would be a piece of news," he answered.
"But, if he did, he's made it all right by this time, of
course, and nobody is the loser."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil drew himself up in his chair, as if righteously
indignant.</p>

<p>"Do you think that is enough?" he demanded,
raising his voice. "By Gad, supposing I tell you my
name was one of those he monkeyed with!"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<p>The other did not seem much perturbed.</p>

<p>"If the paper is all in, I wouldn't make a fuss
about it, if I were you," he replied. "Fern is a good
fellow. He has gone out of business, and I hope
he'll never go in again. Take my advice, if you have
learned anything to his discredit, and keep it to yourself."</p>

<p>Weil could hardly control himself.</p>

<p>"Do you think I intend to let him forge my name
on his notes and checks and not put him under
arrest!" he cried; "when the proofs are beyond
question?"</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs bowed and said he meant that, exactly.
He further remarked that he was astonished that his
friend had any other idea in his mind. The Fern
family was one in which he had been favorably
received and he ought to do everything possible to
prevent harm to any of its members. As he proceeded
in this vein, Mr. Boggs grew so earnest that
he did not notice the broad smile of happiness that
was creeping over the face of his companion, and was
not prepared to find a pair of manly arms clasped
around his neck.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you!" Archie Weil was trying to say.
"You dear, kind, sensible fellow. You've made me
the happiest man on earth! Of course <i>I</i> wouldn't
trouble Fern, but I was afraid <i>you</i> would. He used
your name as well as mine, the rascal! Everything
is paid up, and all the trouble now is that a miserable
scamp has got hold of some of the paper and
wants to blackmail him. And what I called you here
to-day for is to get you to agree&mdash;with me&mdash;to
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>acknowledge every scrap of that paper as being our
own!"</p>

<p>The sudden change was more than Mr. Boggs
could bear for a moment. He sat, to use a common
expression, "like a stuck pig," staring at Archie.</p>

<p>"You remember the nigger that worked for Fern,"
explained Mr. Weil. "He got hold of some of
these notes and checks, in Fern's office, and is
coming to look us up to-day, for the purpose of having
his employer arrested. A nice game, eh? But
we will foil him, won't we? We'll show him a trick
worth several of his! He's probably gone to the
Hoffman House and he'll hang round till he finds
me. I'll send word that I am to be home this afternoon
at five. You will be there with me. We'll
tackle him together. When he tells us that he has
some forged paper in his possession we'll act astonished
and enraged; we'll ask him to show it to us;
and when we've got it all in our hands we'll say the
signatures are our own, and kick him down stairs.
Are you with me, Walker? Is it a go, old boy?"</p>

<p>The agreement was made without more ado. Mr.
Boggs began to see the humorous element in the
affair, and actually came nearer laughing than he
had done since the day he discovered that the size
of his waist placed him out of the list of eligible
"mashers."</p>

<p>When everything was settled, Mr. Weil excused
himself for a few moments, while he tiptoed to Roseleaf's
door and knocked. Daisy came to open it,
and when she saw who the visitor was she blushed
charmingly.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come in," she said. "I am sure both of us are
glad to see you."</p>

<p>Shirley's eyes met those of his friend with a
strange expression. He knew now that all his suspicions
were unfounded, that Weil had proved himself
noble and true. But the apologies that he owed
could not be suitably made in the presence of a third
person, and he made no reference to them. His
changed appearance was enough, however, for
Archie. The reconciliation with the girl of his
heart was perfect, and the happiness that shone from
their faces repaid their good friend for his sacrifice.</p>

<p>"I think I ought to take Miss Daisy to her train
now," said Archie, after the exchange of a few ordinary
remarks. "She can come to see you to-morrow
again, and before many days we will have matters
arranged with pater familias, so that Shirley
can go out to Midlands in his proper capacity. Oh,
you need not redden, little woman! The love you
two have for each other does both of you credit."</p>

<p>Returning to Mr. Boggs, for the sake of allowing
the young couple a few minutes for their good-bys,
Archie dismissed that gentleman with the understanding
that not later than half-past four he would
join him in his room at the Hoffman House. Soon
after he escorted Miss Fern to her station, and before
he left the building Archie sent a dispatch to
her father, asking him to come to the city and meet
him at his hotel at four that afternoon.</p>

<p>Everything worked to a charm. Mr. Fern arrived
at the time designated and went promptly to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
Mr. Weil's apartments. A brief explanation of
what was about to occur threw the wool merchant
into a state of extreme agitation, but he was assured
that the last particle of danger to himself would be
removed before he left the Hoffman House. He was
asked to step into an inner room of the suite, the
door of which was to be left ajar, and to make no
move unless he was called.</p>

<p>Mr. Boggs came at his appointed hour, and Hannibal
soon after. Delighted to find both gentlemen&mdash;accidentally,
as he supposed&mdash;the negro began
without delay to explain the cause of his visit. He
stated the manner in which he had discovered the
forgeries, and said he thought it only his duty to let
the facts be known.</p>

<p>Messrs. Weil and Boggs exchanged glances of well-simulated
surprise as the discoverer proceeded.</p>

<p>"How long is it since you first knew of this matter?"
asked Mr. Weil, when Hannibal came to a
pause.</p>

<p>"Something like eighteen months."</p>

<p>"And you allowed this swindle to go on all that
time without saying a word!" said the questioner.
"I am surprised, when I remember that for a long
time you saw me almost daily."</p>

<p>"That is true," was the quiet response. "I could
not easily bring myself to disgrace one whose bread
I was eating. But that does not matter now. I
have here a number of notes on which Mr. Fern has
forged both of your names. The law will hold him
just as strongly as if I had exposed him at the time."</p>

<p>He exhibited a package of papers, and unsuspici<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>ously
passed them to the two gentlemen. Undoing
the band Archie Weil spread the documents on the
centre table and went over them carefully with Mr.
Boggs, separating those which bore their several
names. A close perusal of all the notes followed,
and finally Mr. Weil looked up and asked if there
were any more.</p>

<p>"No, those are all," said Hannibal. "I believe
there are thirty-six of them."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil consulted in a low tone with Mr. Boggs.
They seemed puzzled over something.</p>

<p>"If these are really all the notes you have," said
Archie, "there has been a great mistake on your
part. These endorsements are genuine in every
case. Where are the forged papers of which you
spoke?"</p>

<p>The negro stared with all his might at the speaker.</p>

<p>"Genuine!" he repeated.</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly, as far as my name is concerned. I
have lent my credit to Mr. Fern for a long time."</p>

<p>"That is equally true of myself," spoke up Boggs,
slowly. "I wrote every one of these signatures and
I am willing to swear to them."</p>

<p>Hannibal's eyes flashed with baffled rage. He
had been trapped. These men had conspired to
save his late employer from his clutches. They had
lied, deliberately, and he was powerless against their
combined assertions, although he knew the falsity of
all they said.</p>

<p>"You will be as glad as we to learn the truth,"
said Archie, in a softly modulated voice. "It would
have grieved you to know that your kind employer
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>had made himself amenable to the criminal law.
Your only object in this matter was to ease your conscience,
and do justice. There is nothing, now, to
prevent your returning at your earliest convenience
to France."</p>

<p>The negro rose and took up his hat.</p>

<p>"This is very nice," he growled, "but I want to
tell you that you are not through with me yet."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil rose also.</p>

<p>"I trust," he said, "that you are not going to be
impolite. I certainly would not be guilty of discourtesy
to you. But let me assure you of one thing:
If you ever, hereafter, annoy in the slightest degree
my friend, Mr. Fern, or any member of his family,
you will wish heartily that you had never been born.
We can spare you now, Mr. Hannibal."</p>

<p>With the last words, Archie waved his hand toward
the door, and without further reply than a
glare from his now blood-shot eyes, the African
strode from the apartment.</p>

<p>"I want you to take a ride in the Park with me,
for an hour or so, and then we will return here for
dinner," said Mr. Weil to Mr. Boggs.</p>

<p>He did this to allow Mr. Fern to leave the house
without Boggs' knowing he was there, and also to
avoid a meeting that he felt would be too full of
gratitude to suit his temperament just then.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXI" id="CHAPTER_XXI"></a>CHAPTER XXI.</h2>

<h3>"WE WANT MILLIE TO UNDERSTAND."</h3>


<p>Millicent Fern had been so busy on her second
novel that she had hardly noticed the prolonged
absence of Shirley Roseleaf from her father's house.
Her first story was selling fairly well and she had
received a goodly number of reviews in which it was
alluded to with more or less favor. Not the least
welcome of the things her mail brought was a check
bearing the autograph of Cutt &amp; Slashem, that
tangible evidence which all authors admire that
her efforts had not been wholly in vain. She had
put a great deal of hard work into her new novel,
and felt that, when Mr. Roseleaf added his polish to
the plot she had woven, it would make a success far
greater than the other.</p>

<p>Millicent thought she understood the young man
perfectly. To her mind he was merely awaiting the
moment when she was ready to name the day for
their marriage. To be sure he had not asked her to
wed him, but his actions were not to be misunderstood.
She would accept him, for business reasons,
and the romance could come later. Together they
would constitute a strong partnership in fiction.
While she was wrapped up in her writing it was
quite as well that he remained at a respectful distance.
Between her second and her third story she
would have time to arrange the ceremony.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>When Roseleaf made his next appearance at dinner,
in the house at Midlands, Miss Fern smiled on
him pleasantly. She remarked that he lacked color,
and he replied that he had been suffering from a
slight illness. Then she spoke of her new story, revealing
the plot to a limited extent, and said it would
be ready for him in about two weeks. The astonished
young man saw that she considered his services
entirely at her disposal, without question,
whenever she saw fit to call upon them. He talked
it over with Daisy.</p>

<p>"You know," stammered the girl, "that Millie
thought you were in love with her. That would account
for everything, wouldn't it?"</p>

<p>"But where did she ever get that idea!" he exclaimed,
desperately.</p>

<p>"She says you tried to put your arm around
her."</p>

<p>"Just to practice. Just to learn what love was
like. I told you how ignorant I was, the same as I
did her. Archie said she would show me, but it
didn't amount to anything. It was only when I
asked you, Daisy, that I began to understand. Do
you remember how you stood on your toes and kissed
me?"</p>

<p>The girl bade him be quiet and not get too reminiscent,
but he would not.</p>

<p>"It taught me all I needed to know, in one instant,"
he persisted. "Ah, sweetheart, how much
happiness and suffering I have had on your account!"</p>

<p>He stooped and kissed her tenderly as he spoke.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"And after this it will be happiness only," she
whispered.</p>

<p>Another kiss answered this prediction.</p>

<p>"What can I do if she asks me to rewrite the whole
of another novel?" asked Roseleaf, with a groan.</p>

<p>"I think you might find time to oblige her," said
Daisy. "But you ought to explain things&mdash;you
ought not to let her misunderstand your position
any longer."</p>

<p>He said that this was true, and that he would act
upon the suggestion. He had her father's consent,
and nothing could stand in the way of his marriage
to Daisy before the year ended. It was not right,
of course, to go on with the implication of being engaged
to both the sisters.</p>

<p>"But I wish I could escape doing that writing,"
he added. "I hate fiction, any way; I have been at
work on one of my own that I fear I never shall
finish. There is much sadness in novels, and I
like joy so much better. I believe I shall abandon
the whole field."</p>

<p>This she would not listen to. She said her husband
that was to be must become a famous writer, for
she wanted to be very proud of him. And Mr. Fern
came in to the room, and having the question put to
him, decided it in the same manner, as he was sure
to do when he learned that his younger daughter
held that opinion.</p>

<p>The retired merchant bore the appearance of a
man from whose shoulders the severe burden of a
great weight had fallen. The tiger that had crouched
so long in his path, ready at any moment to spring,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>had been vanquished. Beyond the profound humiliation
of knowing that his sin was exposed to the
gaze of two of his intimate friends, he had no cause
for present grief. Both of them had proved friends
indeed, and nothing was to be feared from any quarter.
Hannibal had disappeared immediately after
the interview at the Hoffman House, and it was supposed
had gone back to France.</p>

<p>There was to be no haste about the wedding, after
all. Now that the young couple felt perfectly sure
of each other they were more willing than they had
been to wait. The freedom that an understood engagement
brings to Americans was theirs. If Millicent
had only known the true condition of affairs,
and was content with them, they would have been
perfectly satisfied.</p>

<p>An old story tells how a certain colony of mice
came to the unanimous conclusion that a bell should
be hung around the neck of a cat for which they had
a well-defined fear; and it also relates that none of
the rodents were willing to undertake the task of
placing the warning signal in the desired position.
Both Shirley and Daisy wished heartily that Millicent
could be told the exact condition of their hopes and
expectations, but neither had the courage to inform
her. Many of their long conversations referred to
this matter, and one day, when they had discussed it
as usual, Daisy hit upon a bright idea.</p>

<p>"You don't suppose, do you, that Mr. Weil would
tell Millie for us? He has done so many nice things,
he might do one more."</p>

<p>Roseleaf wore a thoughtful expression. He re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>alized
how much Archie had already done for him&mdash;realized
it more fully than Daisy did; but he said
the matter was worth thinking of. He wanted very
much to have it settled.</p>

<p>"Would&mdash;would you&mdash;ask him?" he stammered.
"He would do anything for you."</p>

<p>"Yes," she responded, softly, "I will ask him.
But we had best be together. I do not want to
broach the matter unless you are there."</p>

<p>In a few days the opportunity came. Mr. Weil
heard the voice he loved best explaining the situation.</p>

<p>"We want Millie to understand," said Daisy. "If
she&mdash;if she still likes Shirley herself, there may be an
unpleasant scene, and you will see how difficult it is
for either of us to tell her. But you, who have done
so many kindnesses for us, could convey the information
to her without the diffidence we should feel.
Will you, dear Mr. Weil?"</p>

<p>And Archie said he would, and that it would be a
pleasure to him. And a bright light illumined the
faces of the young people, as another stone was
rolled out of the pathway their feet were to tread.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil did not know how to approach his subject
except by a more or less direct route. One day
he was talking with Miss Fern about her new novel,
and she spoke of Mr. Roseleaf in connection with its
nearness to the required revision.</p>

<p>"I don't know as Shirley will find time to help you
out," he replied. "He is so busy just now with Miss
Daisy."</p>

<p>She did not seem to comprehend him in the least.</p>

<p>"Oh, he is merely filling in the time, as a matter
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>of amusement," she answered. "When I am ready
he will be."</p>

<p>He looked at her earnestly.</p>

<p>"Is it fair to speak of love-making as a matter of
amusement, Miss Fern?"</p>

<p>"Love-making? Is he, then, practicing for his
novel with Daisy, also?" she inquired. "I am afraid
he will get erroneous views of love in that quarter.
She is such a child that she can have little knowledge
of the subject."</p>

<p>She had evidently no suspicion of the truth, and he
determined to become more explicit.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is exactly what he wishes," said he.
"The virgin heart of a young girl certainly affords
tempting ground for the explorations of a novelist."</p>

<p>For the first time she showed a slightly startled
face.</p>

<p>"I trust you do not mean that Mr. Roseleaf is deceiving
my sister with pretended affection?" she
said. "I did not think him that kind of man. If
he is making love to her, as you call it, surely she
understands that it is only for the purposes of his
forthcoming novel?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Is it possible," he asked, "that you do not know
him better than even to hint that suspicion? Shirley
Roseleaf is honor personified. He would not lead
any woman to believe him her lover unless he truly
felt the sentiments he expressed."</p>

<p>Miss Fern looked much relieved.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear you say so," she replied.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>Archie was plunged into a new quandary. He
had evidently made no progress whatever thus far.</p>

<p>"No," he continued, slowly, "he has not deceived
Miss Daisy. His love for her is as true as steel. I
understand their engagement is to be announced in
a few days."</p>

<p>If he had known the pain that these words would
bring to their hearer&mdash;if he had foreseen the anguish
that was portrayed on that brow and in those eyes&mdash;friend
as he was of the young couple who had set
him to this errand, he would have shrunk from it.
Millicent made no verbal reply. Spasms chased
each other over her white face. She seemed stricken
dumb. Her hands, lifted to her forehead, trembled
visibly. And Mr. Weil sat there, uncertain what to
do, as silent as herself.</p>

<p>Gradually the force of the storm passed, and Miss
Fern staggered faintly to her feet. Mr. Weil offered
to support her with his arms, but she refused his aid
with a motion that was unmistakable. She was making
every effort to conceal her agitation, and she
dared not trust herself with words. After taking a
weak step or two, and finding that she could not walk
unassisted, she rested herself upon the arm of a large
chair, and signed to him to leave her. Much mortified,
but knowing no other course, he bowed profoundly
and obeyed the signal.</p>

<p>The next morning he received the following letter
at his hotel:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Mr. A. Weil:&mdash;Sir</span>: If you are in any respect a gentleman&mdash;which
I may be excused for doubting&mdash;you will not
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>allude in the presence of any one to the exhibition I made
to-day. Had I had the least preparation I could have controlled
myself. You adroitly took me at a complete disadvantage,
and you saw the result.</p>

<p>"I leave to-morrow for a new home. Never again shall I
live under the roof of those who have betrayed me. Do not
think I shall succumb to grief because of my sister's conduct.
She is welcome to her victory. No answer to this
is expected.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yours,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;M.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;F."</p></div>

<p>Luckily Archie had escaped from Midlands without
meeting either Daisy or Roseleaf, and he obeyed
as strictly as possible the injunction he received from
the elder sister. All he would say was that he had
informed her of the engagement and that she had
made no reply. When he was told a day or two
later that Millicent had left the house, he merely remarked
that he was not much surprised, as she was
a girl of strong will and usually did about as she
pleased.</p>

<p>Mr. Fern, at first much distressed over his
daughter's action, grew reconciled when he thought
of it more at length. He sent a liberal allowance to
her, which she did not return, and made arrangements
by which she could draw the same sum at her
convenience at a bank in the city.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII.</h2>

<h3>WHERE WAS DAISY?</h3>


<p>The wedding was arranged to occur in the month
of October, and the preparations, so dear to the
hearts of all young women, were pushed with dispatch.
There were to be no ceremonials beyond the
ones necessary, and the company to visit the nuptials
was limited to a dozen of the family's most intimate
friends. When the evening came, Walker Boggs
was on hand, wearing an extra large waistcoat, and
a countenance such as would have best befitted a
funeral. Lawrence Gouger came, his keen eye alert,
foreseeing several chapters in the great novel that
Roseleaf was writing, based on the experiences of the
next few weeks. But Archie Weil wrote a note at
the last minute, regretting that a business engagement
that could not be postponed had called him
to a distant point, and sending a magnificent ornament
in large pearls for the bride, to whom he
wished, with her husband, all health and happiness.</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger had had many arguments with Mr.
Weil, in opposition to the early date set for the wedding.
He had shown that, according to the best
models, the hero of Roseleaf's novel&mdash;which was practically
the young man himself, ought to pass through
some very harrowing scenes yet before his wedded
happiness began. He feared an anti-climax, and was
apprehensive that the wonderful romance would lie
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>untouched for long months while Roseleaf sipped
honey from the lips of his beloved. And he acted as
if these things were entirely at the disposal of Mr.
Weil&mdash;as if the young couple were mere marionettes
whose actions he could control.</p>

<p>"You could put it off if you liked," Gouger said,
complainingly. "You could introduce other elements
that would be the making of the novel, and
you ought to do it. They should not marry before
next spring, at the earliest. You run the risk of
spoiling everything."</p>

<p>"Good God!" cried Archie. "You talk like a fool.
I would have postponed it forever, if I could, and
you know it. But she loves him, and there is nothing
to be gained by delay. Confound you and your
old novel! With the happiness of two human beings
at stake you talk about a piece of fiction as if it was
worth more than a blissful life!"</p>

<p>Gouger straightened himself up in his chair.</p>

<p>"It is worth a hundred times more!" he answered,
boldly. "A novel such as Roseleaf's ought to be
would give pleasure to millions. But I see you are
bound to have your way. The only hope left is that
there will be trouble enough after marriage to spice
the story to the end. A milk and water, nursing-bottle
existence for them would make all the work
already done on this manuscript mere wasted time!"</p>

<p>Weil turned from his friend in disgust. Could the
man talk nothing, think nothing, but shop?</p>

<p>But Archie did not come to the wedding. He
knew the final strain would be more than he could
bear. It was one thing to sacrifice the woman he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>loved and quite another to see her given into the
arms of the rival he had encouraged. One may do
the noblest things, at a respectful distance, and find
himself physically unable to view them at greater
proximity.</p>

<p>Of course Shirley Roseleaf was almost too happy
to breathe. But even the happiest of lovers somehow
manage to inhale a sufficiency of oxygen to
keep life in them, though they have no knowledge
of the process by which this is accomplished. He
had seen several of his productions in type, some in
the leading magazines, and he had a permanent position
now on the staff of a great periodical. When
the month he had allowed himself as necessary for a
wedding journey was ended, he would settle down
to work, and he knew no reason why he might not
make a success in his chosen field. And there was
Daisy&mdash;always Daisy&mdash;he would never again be separated
from Daisy! Who that has loved and been
loved can doubt the perfect content of this young
man?</p>

<p>The saddest face at Midlands was that of Mr. Fern,
who failed in his best attempts to appear cheerful.
He was not sorry that his daughter was to be married,
he would not have put a single obstacle in her
way; but she was going from him, and the very, very
dear relations they had so long sustained would
never be exactly the same again. It was the destiny
of a woman to cleave to her husband. He found no
fault with the law of nature, but he had clung to
Daisy so devotedly that he could not welcome very
sincerely the hour that was to take her away.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></p>

<p>The marriage was to be early in the evening.
Everything was ready, even to the trunks, filled with
traveling and other dresses. The night was to be
passed at the Imperial Hotel in the city, and the
journey proper to be begun some time on the following
day.</p>

<p>On the most momentous morning of her life,
Daisy Fern announced that she had an errand to do
in the city and would return shortly after twelve
o'clock. As she was so thoroughly her own mistress
nobody thought of questioning her more particularly.
But twelve o'clock came, and one o'clock, and three,
and five, and she neither was seen at Midlands nor
was any message received from her.</p>

<p>By the latter hour Mr. Fern was in a state of excitement.
The entire house was in an uproar. The
servants were catechised, one by one, to see if perchance
any of them could guess the young lady's
destination. Word was sent by telephone to various
places in the city, asking information, but none was
received. She had left the house, ostensibly to go
to New York, and nothing could be learned of her
from that moment.</p>

<p>As Mr. Roseleaf was not expected until some time
later, Mr. Fern went at last to the city and sought
the young man at his rooms. He found him in the
company of Lawrence Gouger, dressed for the ceremony,
and impatient for the arrival of the hour
when he should start for his bride's abode. It may
be conceived that the news Mr. Fern brought was
not the pleasantest for him.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you have not seen Daisy?" came the stam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>mering
question, as the father paused on the threshold
of Roseleaf's room.</p>

<p>"To-day? Why, certainly not!" was the stupefied
answer. "I was just about to start for your
house."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern sank upon a sofa just inside the door.</p>

<p>"Something&mdash;has&mdash;happened!" he groaned. "Ah,
my boy, something has happened to my child!"</p>

<p>Roseleaf looked at Mr. Gouger, who in turn looked
at Mr. Fern.</p>

<p>"She&mdash;went away&mdash;this morning&mdash;on an errand,"
enunciated the father, slowly, "saying&mdash;she would
return&mdash;at noon. And&mdash;that is the last we&mdash;have
seen&mdash;of her. Oh, it seems as if I should go mad!"</p>

<p>It seemed as if Shirley Roseleaf would go mad,
too. He looked like one bereft of sense, as he stood
there without uttering a word.</p>

<p>"Perhaps she has returned since you left home,"
suggested Mr. Gouger, on the spur of the instant.
"Don't lose heart yet. Let me send to a telephone
office and have them inquire. You have a 'phone in
your house, have you not, Mr. Fern?"</p>

<p>The father bowed in reply. He was too crushed
to say anything unnecessary. Touching a button,
Mr. Gouger soon had a messenger dispatched for
the information desired, and in the meantime he
tried, by suggesting possibilities, to soothe the two
men.</p>

<p>"You shouldn't get so excited," he protested.
"There are a hundred slight accidents that might be
responsible for Miss Daisy's delay. Perhaps she
has met with an insignificant accident, and the word
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>she has sent to her father has gone astray&mdash;as happens
very often in these days. That would account
for everything. Or she may have taken the wrong
train&mdash;an express&mdash;that did not stop this side of
Bridgeport, and hesitated to telegraph for fear of
alarming you. 'Don't cry till you're hurt' is an old
proverb. Why, neither of you act much better than
as if her dead body had been brought home!"</p>

<p>They heard him, but neither replied. They waited&mdash;it
seemed an hour&mdash;for an answer to the telephonic
message, and it came, simply this: "Nothing has
been heard as yet of Miss Fern."</p>

<p>The thoroughly distressed and disheartened
father shrank before the gaze of the lover, when this
news was promulgated by Mr. Gouger.</p>

<p>"What swindle is this?" were the bitter words he
heard. "Have you decided on another husband for
your daughter, and come to break the news to me
in this fashion?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger interfered, to protect the old man
whose suffering was evidently already too acute.</p>

<p>"Hush!" he exclaimed. "Can't you see that
you are killing him? Be careful!"</p>

<p>Roseleaf waved him back with a <a name="Page_251t" id="Page_251t"></a><a href="#Page_251tn">sweep</a> of his
arm.</p>

<p>"Your advice has not been asked," he replied,
gutturally. "I can see some things, if I <i>am</i> blind.
That girl has gone to the man she loves&mdash;the man
he," indicating the father, "wanted her to marry.
He is rich, and I am poor, and he has won! It is
plain enough! And he pretended, day by day, to
my face, that he had given her up for my sake;
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>and she put her arms around me, and beguiled me
into confidence, in order to strike me the harder at
the end. Well, let him have her! I wouldn't take
her from him. But there's an account between us
that he may not like to settle. When you see your
friend, tell him that!"</p>

<p>Mr. Fern heard these terrible sentences like a man
in a dream. It could not be Roseleaf that was uttering
them&mdash;the man to whom his young daughter had
given the full affection of her innocent heart! He
was mad to talk that way. Mad! mad!</p>

<p>"You will repent these rash statements," said the
old gentleman, rising faintly from his seat. "You
will repent them, sir, in sackcloth. I wish with all
my heart that Mr. Weil was here, for he would at
least try to help me find my child."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger suggested that Mr. Weil would be at
Midlands soon, as he had an invitation to the wedding.</p>

<p>"No," replied Mr. Fern, chokingly. "I received
word from him to-day that he could not attend. He
is out of the city."</p>

<p>Roseleaf gave vent to an expression of nausea.</p>

<p>"Are you yourself deceived?" he exclaimed.
"He will not attend <i>my</i> wedding; certainly not!
He is attending <i>his own</i>. If, indeed, he does not compass
his ends without that preliminary."</p>

<p>Weak and old as Mr. Fern was he would have
struck the speaker had not the third person in the
room interfered.</p>

<p>"Do you dare to speak in that manner of my
daughter!" he cried. "Must you attack the char<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>acter
not only of my best friend but of my child as
well? I thank God at this moment, whatever be her
fate, that she did not join her life to yours!"</p>

<p>With a majestic step he strode from the presence
of his late prospective son-in-law. Gouger, with a
feeling that some one should accompany him, followed.
But first he turned to speak in a low key to
the novelist.</p>

<p>"Do not go out to-night, unless you hear from
me," he said, impressively. "This may not be as
bad as you think, after all. I will go to Midlands
and return with what news I can get. Don't act
until you are certain of your premises."</p>

<p>The young man was removing his wedding suit,
already.</p>

<p>"I shall not go out," he responded, aimlessly.</p>

<p>"You might write a few pages&mdash;on your novel,"
suggested the critic, as he stood in the hallway.
"There will never be a better&mdash;"</p>

<p>A vigorous movement slammed the door in his
face before he could complete his sentence.</p>

<p>Hastening after Mr. Fern, Gouger accompanied
him home, where the first thing he heard was that
there was still no news of the missing one.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<h3>AN AWFUL NIGHT.</h3>


<p>It was an awful night for Wilton Fern. The presence
in the house of Mr. Gouger and Mr. Boggs
aided him but little to bear the weight that pressed
upon his heart. It was better than being entirely
alone, but not a great deal. Together they listened
whenever their ears caught an unusual sound.
Twenty times they went together to the street door
and opened it to find nothing animate before them.</p>

<p>Morning came and still no tidings. The earliest
trains from the city were visited by servants, for the
master of the house was too exhausted to make the
journey. And at nine o'clock the gentlemen who
had passed the night at Midlands took the railway
back to New York, with no solution of the great
problem.</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger had not been in his office an hour before
the door opened and in walked Archie Weil.
The critic started from his chair at the unexpected
sight, and remarked that he had not expected to see
his visitor so early.</p>

<p>"I presume you heard the news and came home
at once," he added, meaningly.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil was pale, and wore the look of one whose
rest has been disturbed.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," he replied. "I
was called away on business that I could not evade,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>and came back as soon as I could. I fear the Ferns
thought it rather rough of me to stay away from the
wedding, but I could not very well help it. You
were there, of course. Everything went off well, I
trust."</p>

<p>The speaker had the air of a man who tries to appear
at ease when he is not. His voice trembled
slightly and his hands roamed from one portion of
his apparel to another.</p>

<p>"Then you have heard nothing!" repeated Gouger,
gravely. "Prepare yourself for a shock. There
was no wedding last night at the Ferns'. Miss
Daisy disappeared yesterday morning, and has not
been seen since."</p>

<p>If Mr. Weil had been pale before, his face was like
a dead man's now. With many expressions of incredulity
he listened to the explanations that followed.
He declared that the occurrence was past belief,
and that he could see no way to account for it.
Clearly something had happened that the girl could
not prevent. She would never have absented herself
of her own accord. She loved the man who was
to be her husband, and if she had wished to postpone
her marriage she could have easily arranged it.</p>

<p>"I can think of nothing but a fit of temporary insanity,"
he added, with a sigh. "And Shirley&mdash;poor
fellow&mdash;how does he take it? Completely broken
up, I suppose?"</p>

<p>When he heard the attitude that Mr. Roseleaf had
assumed, Mr. Weil seemed stupefied. Little by
little Mr. Gouger revealed to him the answers that
the young man had made to Mr. Fern, finally refer<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>ring
to the charge that he (Mr. Weil) had eloped
with the bride. Archie's face grew more and more
rigid as he listened, but the anger that the relator
had anticipated did not show there.</p>

<p>"He is crazy," was the mild reply. "I will go
and see him, at once, and enlist his assistance in the
thorough search that must be undertaken. Come,
Lawrence, leave your work for an hour and go with
me."</p>

<p>Remembering his promise to return in the morning
with the latest tidings, Mr. Gouger put on his
hat and coat and entered the cab which his friend
summoned. He felt that he was about to witness
another chapter that would make most dramatic
reading in that great novel!</p>

<p>"You had best let me go in first," he whispered,
when they stood at Roseleaf's door. "He is in an
excitable frame of mind, I fear."</p>

<p>For answer, Archie brushed the speaker aside and
preceded him into the chamber, without the formality
of a knock. Roseleaf lay before them in his easy
chair, bearing evidence in his attire that he had not
disrobed during the night. He greeted his visitors
with nothing more than a look of inquiry.</p>

<p>"I only heard of your terrible disaster a few moments
ago," said Mr. Weil. "I learn that Miss Daisy
had not been heard from up to nine o'clock this
morning. We must bring all our energies to bear
on this matter, Shirley. Her father is unable to
help us much. For all we know she may be in the
most awful danger. Rouse yourself and let us consult
what is best to do."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>Incredulousness was written on the quiet face that
looked up at him from the armchair.</p>

<p>"Why don't you tell us what you have done with
her?" said the bloodless lips, slowly.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil trembled with suppressed emotion.</p>

<p>"This is no time for recriminations," he replied,
"or I might answer that in a different way. We
must find this girl. Before we go to the police
let us consider all the possibilities, for they will
deluge us with questions. Did any one think," he
asked, suddenly, turning to Gouger, "of sending
word to her sister Millicent?"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger replied that they had done so. A servant
had been dispatched early in the evening to
Millicent's residence and had returned with the
answer that she had heard nothing of Miss Daisy
and did not wish to. She had previously sent a
sarcastic reply to an invitation to attend the wedding.</p>

<p>"And she never came to comfort her father in
his distress!" exclaimed Mr. Weil. "What a
daughter!"</p>

<p>They could get nothing out of Roseleaf. He
answered a dozen times that it would be much easier
for Mr. Weil to send Daisy home or to write to her
father that she was in his keeping, than to attempt
the difficult task of deceiving the police, who would
have enough shrewdness to unmask him.</p>

<p>"Then you will do nothing to help us?" demanded
Archie, his patience becoming exhausted, though he
kept his temper very well. "In that case we must
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>lose no more time. Ah, Shirley! I thought you
worthy of that angelic creature, but now&mdash;"</p>

<p>He checked himself before finishing the sentence,
and went out into the hall.</p>

<p>"I think I had best go to Midlands and consult
with Mr. Fern," he said to Gouger in a low tone.
"There is a possibility that his daughter has
returned since you came away. What an awful list
of horrible thoughts crowd on one! If you can
help me any I will send you word later."</p>

<p>When Mr. Weil was gone, Mr. Gouger opened the
door and looked again into Roseleaf's room. The
young man had not changed his position in the least.</p>

<p>"He has started for Midlands," he said. "What
do you think of his explanation in regard to his
absence last night?"</p>

<p>"I think&mdash;I know&mdash;it is a lie!" was the quick
reply.</p>

<p>"You really believe she went away to meet him&mdash;and
that he has passed the last twenty-four hours
with her."</p>

<p>"Undoubtedly."</p>

<p>The critic waited a minute.</p>

<p>"Do you think they are married?" he asked.</p>

<p>Roseleaf closed his eyes, as a terrible pain shot
across them. He wondered dimly why this fellow
should delight in uttering things that must cause suffering.
Gouger deliberated whether to say more, but
thinking that he had left the right idea in the young
man's mind for the purpose he had in view, he softly
withdrew from the chamber and left the house.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
When Roseleaf looked up again, some minutes later,
he was alone.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Mr. Weil's hand was grasped feebly by the owner
of Midlands, when he came into the presence of the
gentleman. Though completely exhausted Mr. Fern
had not been able to sleep. He listened wearily
while his caller suggested possibilities to account for
his daughter's absence, but could not agree that any
of them were probable. When the idea was broached
of communicating with the police he shrank from
that course, but finally admitted that it must be
adopted, if all else failed. In answer to a hundred
questions he could only say that he had no idea of
anything that could make her absence voluntary.</p>

<p>"She loved her chosen husband devotedly," said
the old man. "When she hears what I have to tell
her she will hold a different opinion."</p>

<p>"Then," said Archie, ignoring the latter expression,
"she must either be the victim of an accident, a
fit of aberration, or&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could not bear to finish the sentence, but the
father bowed in acquiescence.</p>

<p>Lunch was served and Mr. Weil sat down to it,
trying by his example to persuade Mr. Fern to take
a few mouthfuls. Neither of them had any appetite,
and the attempt was a dismal failure.</p>

<p>"I leave everything to you," said the host, as Mr.
Weil prepared to take his departure. "You are the
truest friend I ever had, and whatever you decide
upon I will endorse. But I have an awful sinking at
the heart, a feeling that I shall never see my child
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>alive. Do you believe in premonitions? I have felt
for weeks that some misfortune hung over me."</p>

<p>Before Mr. Weil could reply a servant entered
with a telegraphic message that had just been received.
Tearing it open hastily Mr. Fern uttered a
cry and handed it to his companion:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"I am alive and uninjured. Look for me to-morrow.&mdash;Daisy."</p></div>

<p>A gush of tears drowned the exclamations of joy
that the father began to utter.</p>

<p>"Alive!" he exclaimed. "And will be home to-morrow!
Ah, Mr. Weil, hope is not lost, after all.
But why, <i>why</i> does she leave me in my loneliness
another night? Is there any way in which you can
explain this mystery?"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil confessed his inability to do so. He
tried, however, to show the father the bright side of
the affair, and bade him rest tranquil in the certainty
that only a few hours separated him from the child
he adored. When Daisy came home she would explain
everything to his satisfaction. In the meantime
he ought to indulge in thankfulness for what
he had learned rather than in regrets.</p>

<p>"Go to bed and get a good rest," he added. "I
will make a journey to the telegraph office in the city
and see if it is possible to trace this message. If I
learn anything I will ring you up on the telephone at
once. And remember, if you do not hear from me,
there is a proverb that no news is good news.
Daisy has promised to come home to-morrow. This
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>is something definite. An hour ago we were plunged
in despair. Now we have a certainty that should
buoy us up to the highest hope."</p>

<p>Catching at this view of the case, Mr. Fern consented
to seek rest and Mr. Weil took the next train
to the city. Engaging a carriage he bade the driver
take him with all speed to Mr. Roseleaf's residence.
Notwithstanding the harsh manner in which he had
been treated by his late friend, he wanted to be the
first to inform him that Daisy had been heard from.
He was smarting, naturally, under the imputation
upon his own honor, and felt that the telegram in
his hand would at least remove that suspicion.</p>

<p>"I couldn't help coming again, Shirley," he said,
when he was in the presence of the novelist. "I
know, despite the cruel manner you have assumed,
that you still love Daisy Fern and will be glad to
hear that she is safe from harm. Here is a telegram
that her father has just received, stating that she is
well and will be at home to-morrow."</p>

<p>His face glowed with pleasure as he held out the
missive, but darkened again when Roseleaf declined
to take it in his hand. The young man had not
moved, apparently, from the chair in which he had
been seen three hours before, and his expression of
countenance was unchanged.</p>

<p>"Does she say where she passed the night&mdash;<i>and
with whom</i>?" he inquired.</p>

<p>"No. But she says she is well and will return.
Is not that a great deal, when we have feared some
accident, perhaps a fatal one?"</p>

<p>The novelist uttered a sneering laugh.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>

<p>"My God, Shirley, why do you treat me like this!"
exclaimed Mr. Weil, excitedly. "I have been your
friend in everything, as true to you as man could
be! If I had done the dastardly thing of which you
accuse me, why should I come to you at all? I
could have taken my bride and gone to the other
end of the earth. We need not have adopted these
contemptible measures. But although I <i>did</i> care for
this girl&mdash;more than I ever cared or ever shall care
for another&mdash;I knew it was <i>you</i> she loved and I did
all I could to aid you in your suit. Have you forgotten
how I brought her here, as you lay in that
very chair, and removed the misunderstandings that
had grown up between you? As God hears me, I have
no idea what caused her absence last night! I am
going now to the telegraph office to trace, if possible,
the message and find where she is at present, for I
want to relieve her father's mind still more."</p>

<p>Roseleaf seemed partially convinced by this outburst.
He left his chair, and began slowly to arrange
his attire before the mirror.</p>

<p>"If you are sincere," he said, "I will accompany
you. I will also do my best to discover the resting-place
of this young woman. You must remain with
me till she is found. If we do not see her before to-morrow
morning, we will walk into her presence at
Midlands together. Do you agree to this?"</p>

<p>"With all my heart!" was the joyous reply.</p>

<p>In ten minutes they entered the carriage at the
door, and were driven to the station from which the
telegram had been sent.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.</h2>

<h3>"THIS ENDS IT, THEN?"</h3>


<p>There was nothing to be learned at the telegraph
office. As near as could be remembered a boy had
brought the message, paid for it and vanished. Only
one discovery amounted to anything. The original
dispatch was produced and proved to be in Daisy's
handwriting. Roseleaf attested to this, and he
knew the characters too well to be mistaken.</p>

<p>It was not advisable, in Mr. Weil's opinion, to go
to the police, after the receipt of this word from the
missing girl. It would only add to the notoriety of
the family in case the press got hold of the news.
But he did think it wise to go to see Isaac Leveson
and find a man named Hazen, whose reputation as a
detective was great. He could rely on the absolute
silence of both of them. The ride to Isaac's was
consequently made next, and by good fortune Hazen
happened to be in. He listened gravely to the situation
as it was outlined by Mr. Weil, but expressed
his opinion that nothing would be gained by doing
anything before the next day.</p>

<p>"That telegram is genuine," he said. "It follows
that, unless she is detained forcibly, she will be at
home to-morrow. The writing in this message is
not like that of a person under threats, like one compelled
to send a false statement. Your best way is to
wait till she comes home, providing it is not later
than she indicates, and hear her story. Perhaps it
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>will explain the mystery. If she declines to do this,
I will undertake to probe it to the bottom, if you
wish."</p>

<p>Mr. Roseleaf took no part in this discussion. He
was becoming convinced that Archie Weil was innocent
of any complicity in this affair, but he was still
disinclined to talk much.</p>

<p>"Where shall we go now?" he asked, when they
came out of the restaurant.</p>

<p>"To the Hoffman House?" said Weil, interrogatively.
"I believe with Hazen that we can do nothing
to-night."</p>

<p>Very well, to the Hoffman House they would go.
But they had not been in Weil's room five minutes
when a boy came up with a telephonic message from
Mr. Fern, stating that Daisy was safe at Midlands.</p>

<p>"Let us return without delay," said Weil, enthusiastically.
"We should not lose a moment in removing
this terrible cloud! Come, Shirley, we can
catch the six o'clock train if we hasten."</p>

<p>Mechanically the younger man followed his companion
through the hall, down the elevator and into
a carriage at the door. Forty minutes later they
alighted from the train at Midlands and were soon in
the familiar parlor at Mr. Fern's. A servant who had
admitted them, stated that Miss Daisy had been
home about two hours but that she was now lying
down. He would inquire whether she would receive
the visitors.</p>

<p>What seemed an interminable time followed before
the appearance of Mr. Fern and his daughter.
When at last they came in together, leaning on each
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>other, they were two as forlorn objects as one can
imagine. The sight of his sweetheart's woe-begone
face smote Roseleaf like a blow. He regretted to
the bottom of his heart the cruel things he had
thought and said of her.</p>

<p>"Daisy!" he exclaimed, stepping forward.
"Daisy&mdash;my&mdash;"</p>

<p>He could get no further, for Mr. Fern, with a majestic
motion of his hand, waved him back. The presence
of the intended bridegroom was evidently not
agreeable to the old gentleman.</p>

<p>"Sit down," said Mr. Fern, in a quavering voice,
addressing himself wholly to Weil. "I telephoned
<i>to you</i> that my daughter had returned, for I knew <i>you</i>
would be anxious." He bore with special stress on
the word "you." "I&mdash;I did not know that you intended
to bring&mdash;any other person."</p>

<p>The allusion to Roseleaf was so direct, that he
could not help attempting some kind of a reply.</p>

<p>"Who could be more anxious than I?" he asked, in
a tone that was very sweet and tender; in vivid contrast,
the old man thought, to his manner of the preceding
evening. "No one has a greater interest to
learn where she has been these long, desolate
hours."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern abandoned his intention not to recognize
the fact that Roseleaf was present, and turned upon
him with a fierce glare in his sunken eyes.</p>

<p>"What right have <i>you</i> to ask questions?" he demanded,
pressing the trembling form of his daughter
to his own. "You were the first to doubt her&mdash;even
her innocence&mdash;this lamb that would have given her
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>life for you only yesterday! She has returned to <i>me</i>,
and henceforth she is <i>mine</i>! You could not have
her though you came on your knees! You wish to
know where she has been! Well, you never <i>will</i>!
She will not tell you! It is her own affair. I am
speaking for <i>her</i> when I say that we desire no more
of your visits to this house; we are through with
you, thank God!"</p>

<p>It would be hard to tell which of the two men who
listened to this was the more surprised. Mr. Weil
felt his heart sink as well as did Roseleaf. Daisy
clung to her father, without raising her eyes, and
there was nothing to indicate that she disputed his
assertions.</p>

<p>All was over between her and Roseleaf! Nothing
could bring them together again! And she did not
mean to divulge the cause of her remaining away a
day and a night&mdash;that day and night that had been
expected to precede and succeed her marriage.</p>

<p>Shirley rose slowly. He bent his eyes earnestly
on the father and daughter, and his voice was
firm.</p>

<p>"When one is dismissed, there is nothing for him
but to go. I regret sincerely what I said last night,
when the horror of this thing came suddenly upon
me. I love you, Daisy, and I know by what you
have told me so often that you love me. Are the
foolish utterances of a distracted man to separate us
forever? Conceive the agony I was in when at the
very moment I was to start for my wedding I heard
that my bride could not be found! If I had not
adored you passionately would I have been on
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>the verge of madness, saying and doing things
without reason and excuse? I am ordered to leave
you, my sweetheart, and if you do not bid me stay I
can only obey the mandate. But I love you more at
this moment than ever. All I ask to know is why
you made this flight. If your answer is satisfactory
there will be nothing on my part to prevent our
marriage."</p>

<p>Archie Weil wished that he could have led this
young man aside for just a moment, to show him
that this was no time to make demands or exact conditions.
He had no doubt that Daisy would explain
everything, a little later. All that was wanted now
was a revocation of the dismissal that Mr. Fern had
pronounced. But he could not control the stormy
ocean upon which they rode.</p>

<p>"You seem singularly obtuse," came the shaking
voice of the old gentleman. "It is not for <i>you</i> to
dictate terms. We want to see you no more. Is
not that clear enough?"</p>

<p>It certainly did not seem to be. Roseleaf lingered,
wondering if these were really to be the last phrases
he would hear in that house&mdash;in that very room
where he had expected to hear the words that would
make this sweet girl his for life.</p>

<p>"Daisy," he said, addressing himself once more to
the silent figure, "I cannot believe you have so soon
learned to hate me!"</p>

<p>She looked up at the solemn face and then dropped
her eyes again.</p>

<p>"You will tell me where you were?" he pleaded.
"It is my right to know."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>She looked up again, with a wild horror in her
features.</p>

<p>"Oh, I <i>cannot</i>!" she cried. "I <i>never</i> can tell you.
I never <i>can</i>!"</p>

<p>This statement shocked more than one person in
that room. Up to this moment Mr. Fern had only
understood, from the disjointed expressions of his
daughter when she entered the house, that she did
not wish to be questioned at that time. She had
also explained to him that she had sent the telegram
to make the coast clear of all except her parent, as
she did not wish to meet others on her first arrival.
When he had urged the duty of informing Mr. Weil
she had acquiesced, not dreaming that Mr. Roseleaf
would be in his company.</p>

<p>And now the old man felt that there was more in
the answer she had given than he had suspected&mdash;something
very like a confession of wrong. Mr.
Weil felt this also, though he could not believe Daisy
meant anything very heinous, and Shirley Roseleaf
had a dagger in his breast as he reflected what interpretation
might be given to her words.</p>

<p>"You <i>cannot</i>!" he repeated, ignoring the position
in which he stood, and the presence of the others.
"<i>You must!</i>"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil made haste to allay the storm that he
saw was still rising.</p>

<p>"Let us be considerate," he said. "Miss Fern is
not well. She is tired and nervous. To-morrow,
when she has rested, she will be only too glad to tell
us the history of her strange disappearance."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern looked uneasily from his daughter to the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>gentlemen and back again. He loved her dearly,
and in this new danger that seemed to threaten her&mdash;danger
perhaps even to her reputation&mdash;he wanted
more than ever to shield her from all harm. Whatever
had happened she was his child. She should
not be baited and badgered by any one. But Daisy
did not give him time to speak in her defense. She
answered Mr. Weil almost as soon as the question
left his lips.</p>

<p>"It cannot be. Not to-morrow, nor at any other
time, can I tell you&mdash;or any person&mdash;anything. You
must never ask me. It would merely give me pain,
and heaven knows I shall suffer enough without it.
Let me say a little more, for this is the last time I
shall ever speak of these things. To you, Mr. Weil,
I want to give my warmest thanks. You have been
a true friend to me and mine. I do not mean to
seem ungrateful, but I can tell you no more. And
as for you, Shirley," she turned with set eyes to the
novelist, "you know what we were to each other.
It is all ended now. Even if you had expressed no
disbelief in me when you heard I had disappeared,
it would be just the same. I hold no hard feelings
against you, whatever my father may say. It is
simply good-by. I shall not remain here much
longer. Do not let this make you unhappy any
longer than you can help. Now, you must excuse
me, for my strength is gone."</p>

<p>Daisy had been much longer saying these things
than the reader will be in perusing them. They had
come in gasps, as from one in severe pain, and there
were pauses of many seconds. When she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>finished she rose, and leaning heavily on the feeble
old man who escorted her, walked slowly out of the
room.</p>

<p>"Well, this ends it, then," said Roseleaf, gloomily,
following the fair figure with heavy eyes.</p>

<p>"No, Shirley, it does not; it <i>shall</i> not!" replied
Weil. "There is some dreadful mistake here, and a
little time will clear it away. Have patience."</p>

<p>The novelist gazed at the speaker with a strange
look.</p>

<p>"I have treated you like a brute," he said, slowly.
"And I have treated Mr. Fern just as badly. My
punishment is well deserved. But how can this puzzle
of her absence be accounted for! Of course she
would have had to satisfy me on that point before I
could have married her."</p>

<p>The listener turned giddily toward a window.</p>

<p>"And yet you talk of love!" he said, recovering.
"If that girl had done me the honor she did you I
would not have <i>asked</i> her such a question&mdash;I would
have refused to <i>listen</i> if it gave her the slightest pain
to tell."</p>

<p>"I wonder she did not love you instead of me&mdash;for
she did love me once," was the sober reply. "You
would be a thousand times better, more suitable,
than I."</p>

<p>There was no reply to this, but the two men walked
slowly out of the house and to the station, where
they took the next train for the city. On the way
they talked little, and at the Grand Central Depot
they separated.</p>

<p>Lawrence Gouger, who had in some strange way
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>learned the news of Miss Fern's return, was awaiting
Roseleaf in his rooms.</p>

<p>"Well, I hear the missing one is found," he said, as
the novelist came in.</p>

<p>"Yes. She is with her father. But the peculiar
thing is that she closes her lips absolutely about her
absence. She not only refuses to speak now, but
announces that her refusal is final."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger hesitated what card to play.</p>

<p>"When does the marriage take place?" he asked,
finally.</p>

<p>"With me? Never. I have been thrown over.
Unless she had explained I could not have married
her, any way; could I?"</p>

<p>The critic said he did not know. It would certainly
have been awkward.</p>

<p>"And what is your theory?" he added. "Do you
still lay anything to Weil?"</p>

<p>"No. I am completely nonplussed. But, never
mind. It is over."</p>

<p>Roseleaf stretched himself, and yawned.</p>

<p>"Do you know, Gouger, I almost doubt if I have
really been in love at all. I feel a queer sense of
relief at being out of it, though there is a dull pain,
too, that isn't exactly comfortable. I told Archie
coming in that she should have married <i>him</i>. Upon
my soul I wish she would. She's an awful nice little
thing, and he has a heart that is genuine enough for
her. Well, it's odd, anyway."</p>

<p>Astonishment was written on the face of the other
gentleman as he heard these statements.</p>

<p>"You have at least gained one point," he said, im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>pressively.
"You have done the best part of the
greatest novel that ever was written. Sit down as soon
as you can and finish it, and we shall see your name
so high up on the temple of fame that no contemporary
of this generation can reach it."</p>

<p>"So high the letters will be indistinguishable, I
fear," responded Roseleaf, with a laugh. "Where do
you think I can get the heartiest supper in New
York? I am positively starved. I don't believe I've
eaten a thing since yesterday. If you can help me
any to clear the board, let us go together."</p>

<p>This invitation was accepted, and Roseleaf began
making a more particular toilet, taking great pains
with the set of his cravat and spending at least ten
minutes extra on his hair when he had finished shaving
himself. He never had allowed a barber to
touch his face.</p>

<p>"You won't lose any time on the novel, will you?"
asked Gouger, anxiously, while these preparations
were in progress. "You must take hold of it while
the events are fresh in your mind."</p>

<p>"All right. I'll begin again to-morrow morning,
and stick to the work till it's done. Where shall we
go to supper? I'll tell you&mdash;Isaac Leveson's."</p>

<p>The critic could not conceal his surprise at the
overturn that had taken place so suddenly in the
young man's conduct. He stared at him with a look
that approached consternation.</p>

<p>"You want to go there!" he exclaimed, unable to
control himself. "You wish to dine with some pretty
girl, eh?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf started violently.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span></p>

<p>"No, no! Not&mdash;yet!" he answered. "We can
get a supper room without that appendix. I wish to
be among men as mean as myself. I want to dine in
a house full of people who would cut a woman's
throat&mdash;or break her heart&mdash;and sleep soundly when
they had done it!"</p>

<h3>AN UNDISCOVERABLE SECRET.</h3>


<p>The Ferns did not stay much longer at Midlands.
Crushed by their misfortunes neither cared to remain
near the scenes that had made them so unhappy, nor
where they would be likely to meet faces which kept
alive their grief. The father knew no more than at
first concerning the strange conduct of his daughter.
She had told him nothing, and he had not asked her
a single question. It was enough for him that she
was bowed with a great trouble. His only thought
was to mitigate her distress in every possible way.
He was old&mdash;how old he had not realized until that
week when she changed from a happy, laughing girl,
standing at the threshold of a marriage she longed
for, to a sombre shadow that walked silently by his
side. He was the one who under ordinary circumstances
should have received the care and the
thoughtfulness&mdash;but everything was altered now.
He guided and directed the younger feet, even
though his own were faltering and slow.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Where they had gone no one seemed to know.
Archie Weil received one brief note from Mr. Fern
thanking him again in touching phrase for his many
kindnesses, and saying that Daisy wished to add her
most earnest wish for his happiness. The letter said
they were going away for some time; but no more.
He went one day to Midlands, hoping to learn
something from the servants, and found the home
entirely deserted. A neighbor told him a real estate
agent near by had the keys, but that the place was
neither for sale nor to rent. The agent, when found,
could add nothing to his stock of information. Mr.
Fern had merely mentioned that he was going on a
journey and asked to have a man sleep at the house
during his absence, as a precaution against robbery.</p>

<p>Mr. Weil saw Roseleaf two or three times, but the
interviews were so unsatisfactory that he felt them
not worth repeating. The novelist told him, as he
had told Gouger, that he did not believe he had ever
really loved Daisy, and was actually relieved now
that the strain was ended. No persuasion could
turn him from this statement, which he made rather
in explanation of his present course than as a
defense of it. Gouger had persuaded him that a
love affair was necessary to develop his talents as a
writer. Before he knew what he was about, such an
affair had been precipitated upon him. He had felt
its pleasures and pains to the uttermost, and now it
was ended. All that was left as a result was a pile
of MSS. which the critic pronounced wonderful. It
was as if he had been in a trance, or mesmerized.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
Henceforth he would confine his writings to actualities
or to poetic imaginings.</p>

<p>Talking with a man who held these views was not
inspiring, to put it mildly, and Archie reluctantly
gave up all hopes of making Daisy Fern a happy
woman through this source. He had dreamed of
unraveling the mystery that surrounded her and
placing the young couple again in the position
which, by some horrible mischance, had been so
vitally changed in the short space of one day.
Though he still loved Daisy with all the warmth of his
nature, Archie had no thought of trying to win her
for himself. She had given the fullness of her
innocent heart to Roseleaf and he did not believe
she was one to change her affections to another so
soon as this.</p>

<p>What had happened! What had happened! He
thought it over day by day, and night by night.</p>

<p>Among the things he did before leaving New York&mdash;for
he felt that a journey was necessary for him&mdash;was
to seek out Millicent. He found the elder sister
adamant to every suggestion of love for her family.
She believed herself injured by them, and would
have nothing more to do with either. As to the
strange affair regarding Daisy she declared she had
no theory. She did not think it sufficiently interesting
even to try to formulate one. Her time was
given to writing, and she had found another assistant
that quite filled Roseleaf's place. The firm of
Scratch &amp; Bytum had accepted her latest novel, as
she did not care to have anything more to do with
Mr. Gouger.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>When she mentioned the name of Roseleaf, Mr.
Weil looked at her intently, and saw that she uttered it
with the utmost calmness. She had hardened. Her
fancied grievances had made her a different woman.
She was cynical before, but now she was bitter. He
would not have believed that such an alteration
could have taken place in so short a time.</p>

<p>"What is your new book about?" he asked, trying
to be polite.</p>

<p>"Crime!" she answered briefly. "It deals with the
lowest of the low. It suits the mood I am in. I am
writing of things so terrible that they will hardly be
credited. To get at my facts I have to go into the
most depraved quarters, and associate with the
<i>canaille</i>. But I am going to make a hit that has not
been equaled in recent years!"</p>

<p>He smiled sadly.</p>

<p>"Roseleaf had the same expectation," he said.
"And yet he tells me that he is doing nothing on
that wonderful tale over which I have heard Gouger
rave so often. He has reached a point where he can
go no farther, and unless he rouses himself, all he has
done is merely wasted time."</p>

<p>Millicent closed her eyes till they resembled those
of a cat at noonday.</p>

<p>"Keep watch for mine," she said. "It will be all
I claim for it."</p>

<p>During the winter Mr. Weil was in California. As
spring approached he returned to the East and
visited a well known resort in North Carolina,
where by one of those curious coincidences that happen
to travelers, he found himself placed at table
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>exactly opposite to Mr. Walker Boggs. The ordinary
salutations and explanations followed, and then Mr.
Boggs alluded to a more interesting subject.</p>

<p>"I think I can surprise you," he remarked, "by
something that I learned the other day. Mr. Fern
and Miss Daisy are living within five miles of here."</p>

<p>It was certainly news, and entirely unexpected at
that. Those people might be in Greenland, for all
Archie had known, and indeed he had supposed they
were on the other side of the ocean. He listened
with interest while Boggs went on to say that they
had hired an old plantation house and grounds
and were living a strictly secluded life. The narrator
had seen them in one of his drives through the
country, and had talked a few minutes with Mr.
Fern; but&mdash;and he said it with a touch of pique&mdash;he
had not been invited to visit them, nor had any
apology been made for the neglect.</p>

<p>"By George, I thought it rather tough!" he
added, "considering the way you and I got him out
of that nigger's clutches."</p>

<p>"But you must remember what he has since endured,"
replied Archie, mildly.</p>

<p>"And there's been no explanation, of any sort?"</p>

<p>"Not the slightest. I'd give half I'm worth if I
could get a clue. It worries me all the time. A life
like that girl's ruined&mdash;simply ruined&mdash;in twenty-four
hours, and nobody able to tell why! It's
enough to drive a man frantic!"</p>

<p>Mr. Weil did not drive immediately to Oakhurst,
which he learned was the name of the estate that Mr.
Fern rented, but he enclosed his card in a hotel en<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>velope
and sent it there by mail, without a word of
comment. If they thought it best to see him he
would be glad to go, otherwise he would not intrude
on their privacy.</p>

<p>Several days after&mdash;mails were slow in the South&mdash;an
answer came. It briefly requested that Mr.
Weil and Mr. Boggs, if the latter were still in town,
would come to lunch on the following Wednesday.
Boggs fumed slightly at the apparent difference
made between him and Weil, but ended by going
with his friend to Oakhurst.</p>

<p>Mr. Fern did not look any worse than when Archie
had last seen him&mdash;indeed, if anything, he had improved
in appearance. Time helps most griefs to put
on a better face, and though the marks of what he
had passed through would not be likely to leave his
countenance, the utter hopelessness had in a measure
<a name="Page_278t" id="Page_278t"></a><a href="#Page_278tn">disappeared</a>. When Daisy came into the parlor, she
also wore a mien not quite so crushed as when she
left the room at Midlands with her words of farewell.
Whatever her trouble was, it had not left her
without something to live for. Her youth was doing
its work, and it seemed to the anxious eyes of the
onlooker that time would restore her nearly, if not
quite, to her former radiance.</p>

<p>In the presence of Mr. Boggs, neither father nor
daughter cared to discuss the past. They talked of
the plantation on which they resided, of the pleasant
drives in the vicinity, and of matters connected with
the world in general, of which they had learned
through the newspapers. But after the lunch was
finished Archie found himself alone with Daisy, wan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>dering
through the extensive oak forest that gave
the place its name.</p>

<p>"How long shall you stay here?" he asked her, as
a prelude to the other questions he wanted to follow it.</p>

<p>"I don't know," she replied. "We shall probably
go north during the warm weather, perhaps to the
White Mountains."</p>

<p>He suggested that it must be rather lonesome at
Oakhurst.</p>

<p>"Not for us," she said, quickly. "We are all in
all to each other, and require no thickly settled community
to satisfy us."</p>

<p>"Daisy," he said, after a pause, "there are things
I must say to you, and I hope&mdash;with all my heart&mdash;you
will find a way to answer them. In the first
place, do you believe me, really, truly, your friend?"</p>

<p>She placed her hand in his for answer. The action
meant more than any form of words.</p>

<p>"Then, tell me&mdash;tell me as freely as if I were your
brother, your priest&mdash;why you stayed from home that
night."</p>

<p>She withdrew the hand he held, to place it with
the other over her eyes.</p>

<p>"It is impossible," she responded, with a gasp.
"I told you that I never could explain, and I never
can."</p>

<p>He looked sorely disappointed.</p>

<p>"I know no person on earth&mdash;not even my father,"
she proceeded, giving him back the clasp she had
loosened, "that I would tell it to sooner than you. I
have not given him the least hint. I know it leaves
you to think a thousand things, and I can only throw
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>myself on your mercy; I can only ask you to remember
all you knew of me before that day, and
decide whether a girl can change her whole mental
and moral attitude in a moment."</p>

<p>He drew her arm caressingly through his, and
breathed a sigh on her forehead.</p>

<p>"Not for one second have I doubted your truth!"
he replied. "Believe that, Daisy, through everything.
But I hoped for an explanation, for something
that might assist me to punish the guilty ones,
for such there must have been."</p>

<p>The face that she turned toward him was full of
terror.</p>

<p>"Why do you say that?" she exclaimed.</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no!" she cried, interrupting him. "I do not
want to hear you! We must not talk on the subject!
There is nothing to be told, nothing to be
guessed. This must be alluded to no more between
us. It must end here and now!"</p>

<p>Thoroughly disappointed, he could do no more than
acquiesce in the decision, and he indicated as much
by a profound bow. Then she changed the conversation
by an abrupt allusion to Roseleaf. When he
told her, as he thought it wisest to do, how well the
young man had borne his loss, she said she was very
thankful. She had feared that he would suffer when
he came to his senses, and it was a mercy that this
reflection had been spared her.</p>

<p>He spoke of her sister, and of the call he had
made upon her, suppressing, however, the disagreeable
features of her remarks. Daisy said she had
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>written twice and received no reply. It was evident
that the separation in the family was final.</p>

<p>Toward evening the visitors drove back to their
hotel, discussing the strange events that had occurred.
Archie Weil did not close his eyes that
night. The love he had tried to suppress broke
forth in all its original fervor. He could not sleep
with the object of his adoration five miles away, so
lonely and so desolate.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The next day Mr. Boggs went away, and the next
after this, a new visitor carried from the north. On
coming out upon the veranda to smoke, Mr. Weil
found Shirley Roseleaf there.</p>

<p>The surprise was mutual. Dying of ennui, Archie
was glad even to meet the novelist. They talked for
hours and afterward went to ride together. It appeared
that Roseleaf had come south to get material
for an article in the interest of the magazine on
which he was employed.</p>

<p>One night, a week later, Roseleaf came into Weil's
room and asked if he would like to take a moonlight
canter with him. Glad of any means to vary the
awful monotony Archie accepted, and the horses
were soon mounted. Weil noticed that the route
was in the direction of Oakhurst, but as he supposed
Roseleaf knew nothing of the presence of the Ferns
there, and as the family were doubtless abed at this
time, he made no attempt to induce him to take an
opposite course. It was a sad pleasure to pass within
so short a distance of the roof that sheltered the
one he loved best. On they rode, until they were
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>within a mile of Oakhurst, and then Roseleaf drew
his animal down to a walk. A little further he
turned sharply into a by-path and alighted.</p>

<p>"What's all this?" asked Archie, stupefied with
astonishment.</p>



<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI"></a>CHAPTER XXVI.</h2>

<h3>"I PLAYED AND I LOST."</h3>


<p>Roseleaf did not immediately reply. He busied
himself by tying his horse to a tree, taking particular
pains to make the knot good and strong. He apparently
wanted a little time to think what form of
words to use.</p>

<p>"I want you to see something that will interest
you," he said, finally, in the lowest tone that could
well be heard. "If you will follow my example and
accompany me some distance further I think you
will be paid for your trouble."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil was pale. He felt certain that this
strange visit had been premeditated, and that some
revelation regarding the Fern family was about to be
made. The dread of an unknown possibility for
which he had no preparation&mdash;affecting the girl for
whom he had so deep a love&mdash;unmanned him.</p>

<p>"I have a right to ask you to explain," he responded.
"If your statement is satisfactory I will
accompany you gladly. I do not see the need of any
mystery in the matter."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>The younger man drew a long breath and looked
abstractedly at the ground for some moments. Then
he spoke again:</p>

<p>"There are subjects," he said, "that one does not
like to discuss. There are names that one hesitates
to pronounce. If you will tie your horse and go
with me, your eyes and ears will make questions
unnecessary."</p>

<p>A momentary suspicion flashed through the mind
of the other&mdash;a suspicion that he was being beguiled
to this lonely spot from a sinister motive that boded
his safety no good. But it was immediately dismissed,
and after another second of delay, Archie
slipped from his saddle and followed the example of
his companion.</p>

<p>"Lead on," he said, laconically.</p>

<p>Without waiting for a second invitation, Roseleaf
began to penetrate the wood. He found a footpath,
after going a short distance, and crept along it
slowly, taking evident pains not to make unnecessary
noise. They were going in the direction of Oakhurst,
and in less than ten minutes the chimneys of
that residence could be seen in front of them. A
little further and Roseleaf stopped, placing himself
in the attitude of an attentive listener.</p>

<p>The silence was profound. A slight chill permeated
the atmosphere, but neither of the prowlers felt
cold. On the contrary, perspiration covered the
bodies of both of them. Roseleaf went, very slowly,
along the path, till he came near a fence, and
then, diverging from it, drew himself quietly into a
thick copse, motioning Weil to follow. Here the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>leader sank to the ground, with a motion which indicated
that the journey was temporarily, at least, at
an end, and the second member of the party followed
his example.</p>

<p>Half an hour passed with nothing to indicate the
reason for these most peculiar actions. Half an
hour that was interminable to Mr. Weil, torn with a
thousand fears as to what it might all portend. At
last, however, a faint sound broke the stillness.
Some one was approaching. Roseleaf touched the
shoulder of his companion to indicate the necessity
of absolute silence.</p>

<p>Hardly ten feet away there passed a tall, athletic
form, walking with a quick stride, as of one who has
no suspicion that he is watched by unfriendly eyes.
As the man's face became visible in the moonlight it
was well that Roseleaf had a pressure of warning on
his companion's shoulder. It was almost impossible
for the latter to restrain an exclamation that would
have ruined everything.</p>

<p>It was the face of Hannibal, the negro!</p>

<p>Horrified, Archie turned his bloodshot eyes toward
Roseleaf. What could this strange visit of Hannibal's
to that vicinity presage? Did he intend to
murder the master of the house and abduct the
daughter? What was he doing there, at an hour
not much short of midnight? The terrors of his
previous imaginings gave way to yet more horrible
ones.</p>

<p>But the mute appeal that he shot at his companion
produced no answer, except a resolute shake
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>of the head&mdash;an absolute prohibition against the
least sound or movement.</p>

<p>Hannibal reached the fence and, without any
attempt at concealment, climbed over it into the
enclosure where were situated the house and outbuildings
of the Oakhurst estate. He acted like one
who knows his ground and has no occasion to pick
his way. He went, however, but a little farther in
the direction of the residence. In a place where the
shadow of a smokehouse hid him from the possible
view of any one looking from the windows, he
waited in an attitude of expectation.</p>

<p>The difficulty of controlling himself grew stronger
and stronger for Archie Weil. He wanted to end
this terrible doubt&mdash;to spring over that fence, pinion
this fellow by the throat and demand what business
he had on those premises at that hour. Roseleaf
realized all that was passing in his mind, and kept
his hand still on his shoulder, at the same time warning
him by signs that the least movement would
ruin everything. It seemed to Archie, when he
thought it over afterward, that he had never endured
such pain. He knew beyond reasonable doubt that
Hannibal was awaiting some one by appointment.
Who could it be? That was the stupendous question
that Roseleaf might have answered in a whisper,
but that he preferred for some mysterious reason his
friend should discover in the natural course of events.
And that course was horribly, torturously slow!</p>

<p>Everything has an end, and the dread of the
watcher changed to another feeling as he saw distinctly
one of the outer doors of the residence open
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>and Daisy Fern's form come out. Without glancing
to the right or the left she walked in the direction
where the negro was waiting. For an instant, overcome
by his apprehensions, Archie closed both his
eyes in despair. The voice of Roseleaf was at last
heard in his ear, a whisper nearly inaudible, conjuring
him not to betray his presence whatever the
provocation.</p>

<p>When Archie opened his eyes again he saw that
Hannibal stood in an attitude of respect. When the
girl approached he bowed, without offering any
more intimate courtesy. Daisy had the look of one
who has made up her mind to endure an unpleasant
interview and desires to end it as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>"Well?" she said, in a low tone.</p>

<p>"I am going to-morrow," he replied, in a voice
that shook with emotion.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"And, as I told you, I want to say good-by once
more."</p>

<p>Archie breathed a trifle easier. He could not tell
what fears had crowded upon him&mdash;they were indistinct
in their horribleness&mdash;but some of them had
already flown.</p>

<p>"You are as cold as ever," continued the rich
voice of the negro, in a cadence that was meant to be
reproachful.</p>

<p>"Do you think I could be anything else?" was the
quick reply, as if forced from lips that had meant to
remain silent. "Has your conduct been such as to
make me like or respect you?"</p>

<p>The negro's eyes fell before her indignant gaze.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span></p>

<p>"No," he answered, humbly. "I expect nothing;
I ask nothing. I can see my mistakes now. And
yet, it would have been no different had I played the
part of an angel toward you. The entire question
with you was settled in advance by the fact that my
skin was black."</p>

<p>The pressure on Weil's shoulder grew heavier,
from time to time, as his companion realized his
temptation to break from his covert.</p>

<p>"If it had been as white as any man's who ever
lived," replied Daisy, boldly, "your conduct would
have earned the contempt of a self-respecting person!
A blackmailer, an abductor, a conspirator
against the peace of mind of an old man and a young
girl who never harmed you! I wonder you can talk
of other reasons when you created so many by your
wicked acts!"</p>

<p>Hannibal shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is true, nevertheless," he replied. "I am a
negro. In a moment of insanity I dreamed I was a
Man! I dreamed I might gain for my wife a woman
whose ancestors had been born in a more northerly
clime than my own. To gain that end I took the
only course that seemed open. I possessed myself
of an influence that would make her father fear me.
Well, I played and I lost&mdash;and then, like other players
and losers, even white ones, I was desperate.
You were to be married to another&mdash;a man I hated.
Life had lost its only charm, I could not bear that
you should be his bride. My torture was intense. I
asked but for death."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>These revelations, so novel to at least one of the
listeners, smote him with terrific force.</p>

<p>"You asked for more!" said the girl, hoarsely.
"You asked for my death as well as your own. And
you wanted me to die in such a situation that all the
world would say I had perished willingly with you.
Could anything more cowardly be conceived! Was
anything more dastardly ever devised! It was the
morning of my wedding day; my father was waiting
for me at home; my promised husband was preparing
for the bridal; my friends were invited to
the ceremony. What were all these to you? With
Mephistophelian cunning you sent me a letter in another
person's handwriting, saying that, if I would
come to a certain address, and pay fifty dollars, several
forged notes given by my father would be returned
to me. You knew I would respond. You
knew I would tell no one where I was going, as I
did not expect to be detained more than an hour,
and there was apparently the strongest reasons for
secrecy. And when I was completely in your clutches
you gave me the alternative of <i>marrying</i> you&mdash;ugh!&mdash;or
of taking the poison you had so carefully prepared.
Oh, how <i>could</i> you! how <i>could</i> you, when
you professed to <i>like</i> me!"</p>

<p>There was a low gurgle in Archie Weil's throat,
that he could not suppress. Fearful that it might
be heard in that dead silence, Roseleaf shook his
companion slightly. Mingled with his other emotions
there now came to Weil a stupefied wonder at
the apparent coolness of the novelist.</p>

<p>"When one is willing to die for his love, it should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>not be questioned," said the negro. "I could not
have you in life&mdash;I wanted you in death. I wanted
the world, which had despised me, to think a beautiful
woman had preferred to die with me rather than
marry a man she did not wish to wed. But why
should we recall that dreadful day and night? You
won the victory. You, with your superior finesse,
triumphed over the African as your race has always
triumphed over mine. I demanded love or death.
You dissuaded me from both. And the next day I
permitted you to depart, and saw vanish with you
the last hope of happiness I shall ever feel."</p>

<p>The rich voice of the speaker broke completely at
the close, but the girl who heard him seemed to feel
no sympathy for his distress.</p>

<p>"Always yourself!" she exclaimed. "Do you
ever think of the life you left to <i>me</i>&mdash;a life hardly
more kind than the murder you contemplated. Before
you opened the portals that you had meant
for my tomb you made me swear never to reveal
where I had passed those hours. Never, no matter
what the provocation, was I to utter one word to
implicate you in the tragedy that had ruined two
households. <i>You</i> were the one to be protected&mdash;<i>I</i>
the one to suffer! Had it not been for the sacrifice
to my reputation in being found there with you
dead&mdash;no explanation being possible from my closed
lips&mdash;I would have accepted the alternative and
swallowed the poison rather than live to bear what I
do to-day!"</p>

<p>Weil closed his eyes again. His brain was swimming.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span></p>

<p>"And you are sure," asked the negro, after a
pause, "that you have not violated that promise?
You can still swear that you have never, even by a
hint, given the least cause of suspicion against me?"</p>

<p>"Never!" said the girl. "I consider my oath
binding, notwithstanding the manner in which it
was obtained. You may live in what peace your
conscience allows you, free at least from that fear."</p>

<p>The negro evidently believed her, for he heaved a
sigh of relief.</p>

<p>"Well, good-by," he said.</p>

<p>"Good-by," she replied. "And&mdash;you are not to
come again, remember. There is nothing to be
gained from another meeting between us. If&mdash;if
you want money&mdash;I can send it to you."</p>

<p>He lifted his head rather proudly at the last suggestion.</p>

<p>"I do not want any," he said. "I am not low
enough for that. I took the sum from you to go to
France, because I hoped&mdash;in my infatuation&mdash;that I
could make myself something that you would not
despise. If I had wanted money I could have got
thousands out of your father, and I could still, notwithstanding
the pretence of those men that they
wrote the signatures I saw him forge. No, I mean
to give you back what I had from you, if ever I can
compose my mind enough to go to work and earn
it. I have no ambition. I stay in my mother's
cabin, day after day, unable to make the least effort.
Perhaps I can do something&mdash;in time."</p>

<p>The negro took a step away, and then turned, as if
unable to go so abruptly.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>"Good-by," he said, again.</p>

<p>"Good-by," answered Daisy, impassively. "I
want to tell you, now I think of it, where I got that
$1,000 I gave you. It was lent to me by the man
you hated so, Mr. Roseleaf."</p>

<p>Hannibal did not seem to care for this information.</p>

<p>"He did not lend it for any good-will to me," he
replied. "I have heard, by-the-way, that he did not
mind losing you&mdash;this man for whom you spurned a
heart that worshiped your very footprints. I believe
some day I'll take a shot at him."</p>

<p>The girl shuddered.</p>

<p>"It would be like you," she said, "if no one
was looking, and he did not know of your presence.
I don't believe, with all your claims, there is a manly
trait in you."</p>

<p>The tall form drew itself up and the athletic arms
were folded firmly.</p>

<p>"Take care!" said the red lips, sharply, and the
ivory white teeth gleamed.</p>

<p>"Oh, I am not afraid," replied Daisy. "My maid
is watching us from behind the blinds of my room.
I told her my own story about why I was to meet
you, but should harm happen to me the alarm bell
would ring out."</p>

<p>Startled visibly at this information, Hannibal
glanced in the direction indicated, and then began
to take his departure in earnest.</p>

<p>"All right," he said, as he mounted the fence.
"Keep your word and I'll keep mine. But if you
play any tricks, remember that's a game for two."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>

<p>The men could not arise without startling Daisy,
who would undoubtedly have uttered a loud scream
had they suddenly appeared before her vision. They
saw her stand there for at least ten minutes, before
she went into the house. When she was out of sight,
Weil crawled into a safer place and rose to his feet.</p>

<p>"I am going to follow that cur!" he muttered, between
his teeth.</p>

<p>"To-morrow is soon enough," was the calm reply
of his friend. "I know where he lives."</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII.</h2>

<h3>ABSOLUTELY BLAMELESS.</h3>


<p>Most men who are by nature excitable surprise
their friends on occasions by exhibiting great calmness.
Shirley Roseleaf, who had often been thrown
into the greatest heat by far less important happenings
than the one just narrated, seemed a picture of
repose as he walked through the wood with his
friend in the direction of the horses they had tethered.</p>

<p>"How did you discover they were going to have this
meeting?" asked Weil, nervously. "I am all at sea."</p>

<p>"I have been on his track ever since the day I was
to have been married," was the reply. "I didn't intend
to leave a mystery like that unsolved. I discovered
that the Ferns were living here, and that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
Hannibal originated a few miles further on. I found
that Miss Daisy was still a little afraid of him, that
he was using an influence over her which was to say
the least strange. Before I got at the truth I had
some queer misgivings, you may believe."</p>

<p>Mr. Weil stared at his companion.</p>

<p>"But how did you learn all this?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Oh," said Roseleaf, with a slight laugh, "I've
been in this neighborhood for two months. They
haven't met once but I heard every word they said.
Little by little I gained the truth of the matter.
And to-night, as it was perhaps the last time they
would be together, I wanted you to understand it
perfectly."</p>

<p>Archie frowned at the thoughts that crept in upon
his brain.</p>

<p>"Excuse me for saying that you don't appear to
mind it much," he muttered. "If you have heard
many conversations like the one to which I just
listened, and could go away without expressing the
thoughts you ought to feel, you are made up differently
from me."</p>

<p>"That may be so, too," smiled the other, good-humoredly.
"But remember that things are changed.
I once was a man in love&mdash;now I am simply a writer
of romance."</p>

<p>The elder man shivered.</p>

<p>"Could one be actually in love with a girl like that
and then recover from it?" he asked, half to himself.</p>

<p>"I don't think I ever was very much in love," was
the quick reply. "But never mind that. Let us
talk of Hannibal. You spoke of going after him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
What would you have done had you carried out that
intention?"</p>

<p>Weil had not thought of the matter in this concrete
form. He had wanted to punish the negro for
his crimes against the woman he so dearly loved,
against the old man for whom he had such a warm
affection. How he would have accomplished this he
had not decided. The first thing was to follow and
tax the wretch with his offense. Subsequent events
would have depended on the way Hannibal met the
accusation. Certainly the temper of the pursuer
would have been warm, and his conduct might have
been severe.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "I should have told
him for one thing that he would have to reckon with
something more than a weak girl or a poor old man
if he annoyed that family again. In case he had
been impertinent I cannot say what I might have
been tempted to do."</p>

<p>"All the more reason for congratulating yourself,"
replied Roseleaf, as they reached the horses, "that
you did not follow him. He has promised to keep
away from the Ferns, and I think they have seen the
last of him. What is done can't be undone, ugly as
it is. Now," he continued, vaulting into his saddle,
"your course is reasonably plain. You must visit
Miss Daisy soon, let her know that the extent of her
misfortune is in your possession, and after a reasonable
time, ask her to marry you."</p>

<p>Archie Weil, who had also mounted his horse,
came near falling from the back of the animal at
this very abrupt suggestion.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></p>

<p>"That is just what you should do," continued
Roseleaf, without allowing him to speak. "You are
desperately in love. Daisy likes you very well, and
it would take but little effort on your part to induce
even a warmer sentiment. Her father thinks you
one of the angels that came down to earth and
forgot to return to heaven. She ought not to go
through life alone. Her only trouble is the suspicion
that rests on her name&mdash;a suspicion she considers
herself bound in honor to do nothing to lift. Show
her that you know how innocent she is, and you will
bring a new light to her eyes, a new smile to her
lips."</p>

<p>"But," asked Archie, catching at the straw, "how
can I tell her&mdash;how can I explain the source of my
information?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf laughed.</p>

<p>"By the novel method of using the truth, or at
least a part of it," he said. "Tell her you were out
riding and saw Hannibal, and followed him. You
needn't count me into it. Why, you've got to let her
know, or else I have. It's a thing she would almost
give her life to have revealed without her aid. Go
like a man and take that heavy weight off her young
soul."</p>

<p>Finally Weil consented. He would not discuss
the question of whether he would afterwards speak
of the hope that lay nearest his heart. But he would
go to her, as Roseleaf suggested, and relieve her of
the strain that had worn so deeply. He would go
the very next day. The sooner it was accomplished
the better. The more he thought of it the more de<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>lighted
he grew that he could carry such tidings.
He could make Daisy happier. That was enough
for him&mdash;at present. If he could make himself
happy at a future date&mdash;but there was time enough
for that.</p>

<p>He sat upright in his saddle and exulted as his
horse bounded nimbly over the ground. Why was
it not already day, that he might turn the beast in
the opposite direction! The hours would be very
long before the sun rose and he could start on his
joyful errand. The sombre hue of his countenance
disappeared before the contentment that began to
fill his breast.</p>

<p>He slept well, notwithstanding the fact that he
expected to lie awake all night when he retired. In
the morning, on going down to breakfast, he found
that Shirley had left still earlier, leaving word that
he had started on a quest for game. Weil did not
mind. He had enough before him for one day. He
was going to see Daisy, and he had that to tell which
would lighten the load she had so long felt compelled
to carry.</p>

<p>He waited until after nine o'clock, feeling that
some regard must be paid to <i>les convenances</i>, even on
such an important occasion as this. When he was in
the saddle he rode as slowly as he could bring himself
to do, to make his arrival still later. At last he
reached the gate of Oakhurst, and when he had summoned
the porter he sent him for Mr. Fern, stating
that he had happened to ride in that direction and
wanted merely to make a short call.</p>

<p>It was but a few minutes before the servant re<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>turned,
and the hospitable master of the premises
came with him. Mr. Fern <a name="Page_297t" id="Page_297t"></a><a href="#Page_297tn">upbraided</a> Weil for using
so much ceremony, remarking that although he was
living in a retired way, there was always one friend
he was glad to see. Giving up the horse, Archie
accompanied his host to the house, where the latter
said he would send at once for Daisy.</p>

<p>"A minute," interpolated Archie. "I want a little
talk with you first, alone."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern looked up curiously. He believed he
knew what his visitor was about to say. He had
long suspected the feelings which Archie entertained
for Daisy. He knew also that his daughter would
consent to wed no man, no matter who, while there
hung over her fair fame the terrible mystery of her
wedding night.</p>

<p>"I want to tell you," pursued Archie, before his
host could interrupt, "that I have made a great discovery&mdash;one
of the utmost moment to your family.
I know what happened on that day so sad to all of
us, and&mdash;listen to me, Mr. Fern!&mdash;I know that your
child is absolutely blameless in the matter."</p>

<p>The listener's face grew very white. He understood
imperfectly, but it seemed to him that a tale
he could not bear to hear was about to be forced
upon him.</p>

<p>"Mr. Weil," he said, earnestly, "I hope you will
not continue this subject. I do not know what
occurred&mdash;I do not wish to know. I have consulted
my daughter's sentiments entirely. She prefers to
have the veil unlifted, and I respect her wish."</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span></p>

<p>The visitor could hardly contain himself for impatience.</p>

<p>"That has been true hitherto," he replied. "But
Miss Daisy herself will be more than delighted when
she knows I am aware of the entire facts&mdash;which she
has been prevented, by a promise extracted from her,
from revealing. Call her, let me tell her that I
know everything, and how I know it, and you will
see the happiest girl in America."</p>

<p>Mr. Fern shook his head doubtfully. He was
much afraid of doing something to injure Daisy's
feelings. He could not believe she wanted to have
the trouble that had crushed her raked up by any
one. Archie persisted, however, and his arguments
at last won the day.</p>

<p>"You do not think I would come here with any
tidings I did not believe agreeable?" he said, interrogatively.
"You know I care too much for&mdash;for
both of you&mdash;to do that."</p>

<p>When Miss Daisy was summoned, which she was
at last, and Mr. Weil gently let drop a hint of what
he had to tell, the girl was hardly less agitated than
her father had been. Instead, however, as the visitor
expected, of relying on her natural protector
during the expected recital, she whispered to Mr.
Fern, who obediently rose and let her lead him out
of the room. Presently she returned, and took a
chair opposite to Mr. Weil. Her face was so
pathetic, her attitude so entreating, that he quite
forgot what he had come to tell, and leaning toward
her, took her hands in his.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span></p>

<p>"Daisy," he said, "I&mdash;I&mdash;" and he could go no
further.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," she answered, in a low voice.
"But there is a reason why I cannot listen to you. I
have told you that before. I ought not even to say
as much as this. I should not even remain in the
room while you explain the least thing."</p>

<p>He choked down the rising in his throat and hastened,
lest she should follow literally the sentiment
she had outlined and leave him to himself.</p>

<p>"This has all been true, until now," he said. "You
were under a promise, an oath. But&mdash;Daisy, last
night I heard all that passed between you and your
persecutor, and there is no longer any need for mystery
between us."</p>

<p>She gasped, as if her breath was going.</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you heard!"</p>

<p>"Everything. I was within forty feet of you.
Are you sorry that the awful cloud is blown away&mdash;that
your perfect innocence is proved without a
violation of your plighted word?"</p>

<p>For the girl was crying, slowly, without hysteria,
crying with both her hands tightly clasped over her
eyes.</p>

<p>"<i>I</i> did not need it, not I," continued the man,
earnestly. "I knew you had done nothing of your
free will that the whole world might not know. But
I knew, too, that you would be pleased to have your
innocence established. And I was glad for another
reason. I love you, Daisy. I have loved you a very
long time. Your sister was right in that. Had you
not shown such a marked preference for my friend I
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>would have done my best to win you, months and
months ago. While you felt that you were an object
of suspicion I knew you would not consent to
be my wife. Now, that obstacle is gone and&mdash;Daisy&mdash;I
want you."</p>

<p>The hands were withdrawn from the tear-stained
face, a handkerchief was hastily passed over it, and
Daisy turned half away from the speaker.</p>

<p>"You will not refuse, my love," he murmured,
bending again toward her. "You will promise?"</p>

<p>One of her hands strayed toward him, and was
clasped joyfully in his own.</p>

<p>"But, in relation to that other matter," said Daisy,
some moments later, when the sweet tokens of love
had been given and taken, "I must be as silent as
before. I have listened to you, but I have not replied.
You can understand the reason. Never
speak of it to me again, if you do not wish to inflict
pain. It is something I cannot discuss."</p>

<p>"I may tell your father, though," he whispered.</p>

<p>"It would be best not. He is content now. No,
I beg you, say nothing to any one."</p>

<p>And he promised, like the lover he was, and sealed
it with another kiss on her pure mouth.</p>

<p>"I may tell him of&mdash;of our love?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we will tell him of that together."</p>

<h3>TRAPPING A WOLF.</h3>


<p>When Shirley Roseleaf left the hotel that morning
he carried a fishing rod, a rifle, a gamebag and
other acoutrements of the sportsman. In his earlier
years, before he ever came to the city, he had been
accounted something of an expert with these implements.
Since being in this country where there was
so much to tempt a Nimrod he had made a number
of similar excursions. Although it was some distance
to the locality where he intended to go the
young man did not take a conveyance of any kind.
He walked briskly over the road, breathing the pure
air of that early hour, and whistling in a low tone to
himself as he went along.</p>

<p>Among the other things he carried was a light
lunch, for he did not care to break his fast so
early in the day. He had, besides, a contrivance
for making coffee and for broiling the fish he
expected to catch. Even if his jaunt lasted till night
his physical needs were well provided for. One
would not have imagined, to see his free and easy
swing over the road, that he had anything of greater
moment on his mind than to watch for some stray
rabbit, or a possible deer track.</p>

<p>Not less than six miles from his starting point, he
came to a small lake, to reach which he had followed
a narrow path that led through the wood. On the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>shore was a primitive rowboat, or rather canoe,
which he had purchased on another occasion from a
native for an insignificant price. Into this boat the
novelist stepped, and after safely depositing his traps,
took up the paddle and used it skillfully. When he
had reached approximately the centre of the lake, he
sat down, prepared his fishing tackle and began to
angle for the denizens of the water below.</p>

<p>With the patience of a true fisherman Roseleaf sat
quietly for two hours, during which time he had
drawn out but few specimens. The long walk had,
however, given him the appetite he needed, and he
now pulled his frail craft toward the shore, with the
intention of lighting a fire and preparing a meal. But
even when he had nearly reached land he saw splinters
flying beneath his feet, and immediately after heard a
dull sound which showed what had caused the
trouble.</p>

<p>A stray bullet, from some careless hunter, had
penetrated his canoe. The hole was large enough to
render the boat useless, for the water began to come
in rapidly. With two more stout movements of the
paddle Roseleaf forced his craft against the shore and
sprang upon dry land. Then he quietly picked up
the things he had brought with him, and walked a
little away from the scene.</p>

<p>"These fellows are getting altogether too careless,"
he muttered, as he inspected his damp belongings.
"A little more and that thing would have
been tearing splinters in me."</p>

<p>Scraping some dead wood together, he soon had a
fire started, and the cooking of his breakfast was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>begun. He went about the work methodically,
whistling again in that low key he had used when on
the way from his hotel, and stopping now and then
as the noise of a woodbird or some wild quadruped
of the smaller kind came to his ears. He sniffed the
coffee that was boiling furiously and the freshly
caught fish that sent out an appetizing aroma. No
meal served at the Hoffman, the Imperial or the far-famed
Delmonico restaurant, could equal this primitive
repast, for him.</p>

<p>Finally, all was ready. Helping himself to a large
plateful of the delicious food, and pouring out a
huge tin cup of the coffee, Roseleaf sat down as if
to take his ease while breakfasting. But, instead of
touching the viands he had been at such pains to
prepare, the next thing he did was to fall prone on
the ground. And at the same instant a second bullet
whizzed past him and buried itself with a tearing of
bark and wood in the tree just behind him.</p>

<p>If Roseleaf had laid down with suddenness he rose
with no less speed. As he sprang to his feet he
picked up his rifle. He made a dozen steps forward,
and then, bringing the weapon to his shoulder,
cried to some one in front of him:</p>

<p>"Halt, or I fire!"</p>

<p>A human form that had been creeping away on its
hands and knees, now stood upright. It was perhaps
thirty yards from the speaker, and when it faced him
he saw that the countenance was black.</p>

<p>"Don't come any nearer and don't go any farther
off," said the novelist, gravely. "You are at a con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>venient
distance. I can shoot you best where you
stand."</p>

<p>The negro looked considerably crestfallen. He
seemed doubtful whether to break and run or stay
and try to face it out.</p>

<p>"I can't help an accident," he said, at last, when
the other remained covering him with the rifle.</p>

<p>"No," was the answer. "An accident is liable to
happen to any one, they say. But two accidents, of
the same kind, on the same day&mdash;accidents that
might either of them have been fatal if you were not
such an awfully bad marksman&mdash;are too many.
When <i>I</i> get ready to fire, there will be no accident."</p>

<p>The negro was plainly uneasy. He cast his eyes
on the ground and writhed.</p>

<p>"You have dropped your gun," said Roseleaf.
"That was right. It would have incommoded your
flight, and its only cartridge was used. You would
have had no time to reload. I know that gun very
well; I have heard it many times in the last six
weeks. I knew the sound of it to-day when you
fired the first time. A rifle has a voice, like a man;
did you know that? I knew it was your gun and
that you were at the end of it. With that information
in my possession, of course you couldn't catch
me napping twice. I pretended to watch my cooking,
but in reality I watched nothing but you.
There is no need that you should say anything, Hannibal.
You could not tell me much, if you tried."</p>

<p>The speaker examined his rifle carefully, still keeping
the muzzle turned toward the person he was
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>addressing. The latter did not seem to grow less
uneasy.</p>

<p>"I spent some time last evening," continued Roseleaf,
presently, "in listening to a little conversation you
had with a certain young lady living a mile or so from
this spot. That surprises you, does it? I thought it
might. I learned how you had ruined her peace of
mind, how you had artfully contrived to make her
appear the opposite of what she really was. Now,
you have tried twice within the last hour to murder
me. For this I could have forgiven you. What you
did to that young woman is, however, a more serious
matter. I don't think anything less than pulling this
trigger will expiate that."</p>

<p>He placed the rifle to his shoulder again, as he
spoke, and glanced along the sight. The negro half
turned, as if of a mind to attempt an escape, and
then, realizing the hopelessness of such a move, sank
on his knees and raised his hands piteously.</p>

<p>"If you have anything to say, be quick!" said the
hard voice of the man who held the rifle.</p>

<p>Then Hannibal blurted out his story. He told
how he had been led, step by step, to hope that he
might rise above his station, until the wild idea entered
his brain that he could even make Daisy Fern
love and marry him. He pleaded the disappointments
he had suffered, the terrible revulsion of feeling
he had undergone, the broken life he had been
obliged to take up. He did not want to be killed.
If allowed to go he would swear by all that was
good never to cross the path of the Ferns, or Roseleaf,
or any of their friends again. When his
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>treaties brought no verbal response he grew louder
in his tone, feeling that something must be done to
move the deaf ears to which he addressed his petition.</p>

<p>"If I allowed you to leave here, you would try to
shoot me the next time you had a chance," said the
novelist. "I should merely be giving my life in exchange
for yours, which I do not consider a good
bargain."</p>

<p>"No, I swear it before God!" came the trembling
words in reply.</p>

<p>"I cannot trust you."</p>

<p>A slight sound attracted the attention of Roseleaf
as he uttered the latter words. It was the sound
that oars make when dipped in water. With a quick
glance to one side he beheld a rowboat, in which
were seated Archie Weil and Daisy Fern, and they
were coming directly toward him.</p>

<p>"Here are some of the others you have wronged,"
he said, pointing. "I will wait to see if their opinions
agree with mine."</p>

<p>Daisy saw him first, as Weil was handling the
oars, and she called her companion's attention to
him. Archie called his name.</p>

<p>"Come here!" was Roseleaf's reply. "I have
winged a black duck and I cannot leave."</p>

<p>A few more movements of the oars brought the
boat to the shore, and the surprise of its occupants
can be imagined when they saw the tableau that
awaited them. Hannibal was still groveling on the
earth, and the attitude of Roseleaf plainly showed the
cause of the negro's terror.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p>

<p>"What has he done?" was the first question, and
it was Daisy's voice that asked it.</p>

<p>"Let him tell," replied Roseleaf, nonchalantly.
"Tell the lady what you did, Hannibal."</p>

<p>With a courage born of his knowledge of the young
lady's kind heart, Hannibal now turned his attention
toward her. He begged her to plead with his would-be
executioner to give him one more chance for his
life, and reiterated his promises to cease meddling
with all of their affairs if this was granted. As he
spoke Daisy crept nearer to Roseleaf's side, and when
he paused for a moment to gain breath, she laid her
fair hand on the rifle.</p>

<p>"You would not kill a fellow creature?" she said,
gently.</p>

<p>"A fellow creature?" he retorted. "No! But a
wolf, a snake, a vulture&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>She shook her head slowly, while Mr. Weil looked
on, uncertain what to do or say. He wanted more
than anything else in his life to lay hands upon the
cause of all her woes.</p>

<p>"You have not told me yet what he has done,"
she said.</p>

<p>"He shall tell you," replied Roseleaf, sharply.
"Stand up, Hannibal, and answer truly the questions
I am about to propound to you."</p>

<p>The crouching figure tottered to his feet. The
negro was weak from fear.</p>

<p>"Did you try twice this morning to murder me?"</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the shaking voice. "But I was
insane with my troubles&mdash;I did not realize what I
was doing&mdash;I&mdash;"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span></p>

<p>Daisy's slight hand, still on the barrel of the rifle,
was bearing it steadily to the ground.</p>

<p>"Once," she said to Roseleaf, impressively, "you
told me you loved me! Have you regard enough
left to grant me a favor?"</p>

<p>He shook his head.</p>

<p>"There are favors," he said, "that are crimes. It
is one's duty to exterminate vermin, in the interest
of the human race."</p>

<p>But, even as he spoke, she was having her way.
Her slight strength had taken the weapon from
him.</p>

<p>Then, with the face of a forgiving angel she turned
toward the negro and uttered very softly one word,
"Go!"</p>

<p>Glancing at the others to see if he might safely
follow this direction, Hannibal disappeared in the
thick woods behind him. He walked with an unsteady
step. There was a strange lightness in his
brain. Some distance away he found the boat in
which he had come, and entered it, staggeringly.
Pushing from the shore with a feeble touch on his
paddle he set out for his home.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The negroes who found his body, a week later,
could not decide whether he had perished by accident
or by deliberate intention. The boat was not
capsized, but it was partially filled with water, indicating
either that he had tried to sink the craft or
had leaned too heavily to one side in something like
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>a stupor. When his gun was discovered on the
shore, new speculations were set in motion.</p>

<p>Those who knew him recalled that he had been
moody for a long time&mdash;in fact, ever since he came
from the north. They remembered him as a young
fellow, four or five years previous, not very different
from his mates; and they had stared in wonder when
he returned with fine clothes and money in his
pocket. The dislike between him and his old acquaintances
was mutual. They could not understand
him; and what an inferior mind does not comprehend
it always views with suspicion.</p>

<p>A grave was made near the border of the lake, and
the single word "<span class="smcap">Hannibal</span>" was written on the
board that marked the spot. But later some envious
hand scrawled beneath it:</p>

<p>"<span class="smcap">He wanted to be a gentleman!</span>"</p>

<h3>"THE GREATEST NOVEL."</h3>


<p>Archie Weil and Daisy Fern were married in June.
There was no need of waiting longer. It was a case
of true love sanctified by suffering and devotion.
The bright eyes and ruddy cheeks of the bride testified
to her renewed health and spirits. The news
of Hannibal's death&mdash;albeit it brought a tear to her
eyes, had removed the only shadow that stretched
across her pathway.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span></p>

<p>Shirley Roseleaf did not come to the wedding, to
which he was the only invited guest. He wrote
that an important mission from his magazine made
it impossible to accept the invitation, but he sent a
handsome present and a letter to Archie, congratulating
him in the warmest manner.</p>

<p>For some time Lawrence Gouger had been urging
the novelist to hasten the wonderful story that was
to make his fortune and give a new impetus to the
house of Cutt &amp; Slashem. They had consulted together
a hundred times, and the thirty chapters already
finished seemed to leave but a few weeks'
steady work to be accomplished. Shortly after
the wedding Gouger went to Roseleaf's rooms, one
evening, and begged him to lose no further time.</p>

<p>"What is there to wait for now?" he asked.
"All the dramatic incidents have occurred. You
only need to wind up with a glory of fireworks, showing
virtue triumphant and vice buried under a North
Carolina sycamore. Come, my dear boy, when may
I expect to see the work completed?"</p>

<p>Roseleaf did not answer for some seconds.</p>

<p>"There is a part of this story that you do not
comprehend," he said, finally. "A chapter is yet to
be written at which you have not guessed."</p>

<p>"Indeed!" exclaimed the listener.</p>

<p>"Yes," nodded the other. "So far the character
that is supposed to represent myself appears that of
a heartless, cold, unfeeling wretch. Do you think
I shall be satisfied to leave it that way?"</p>

<p>The critic stared at the speaker in astonishment.</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span></p>

<p>"I&mdash;I do not understand," he replied.</p>

<p>"I thought not," said Roseleaf, soberly. "Well,
this story, to be truthful, must do justice to the one
who is supposed to personate its author. And, in
the first place, to avoid all circumlocution, let me tell
you there has never been a moment since I first
loved Daisy Fern that she has not been the dearest
thing on this earth to me!"</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger could not reconcile this statement with
the events that had taken place, and his puzzled
countenance said as much.</p>

<p>"I acted like a villain, did I not," continued Roseleaf,
after a slight pause, "when the news was brought
that she had disappeared? I seemed to have no faith
in her, no confidence in Archie, no trust in that poor
old man, her father. Why? I was so madly, insanely
in love that every possible phantasy got possession of
my excited brain. To lose her was to deprive me of
all hope, all ambition, all care for life. So far, I acted
my real self. If what I supposed true had been
proven I think there would have been a murder.
Not of Daisy; ah, no! but of the man who had
robbed me of my treasure. Then I went to Midlands
with Archie and I saw her. I heard her speak, and
like a lightning flash it came to me. He was as honorable
as a man could be and she cared more for him
than for my unworthy self. She had contrasted us
and discovered how much he was my superior. And
I said to myself at that moment, 'I will give her up!
If it costs me my happiness as long as I live I will
give her up! No matter what happens, I will unite
these people, who have been so faithful to me and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>toward whom I have acted the part of a cur and a
coward!'"</p>

<p>The young man was speaking with perfect composure,
but with intense earnestness.</p>

<p>"The first thing to be done," he continued, "was
to take myself out of their way. The next was to
unravel the mystery that had made the trouble. I
knew, when my mind had resumed its natural state,
that, whatever had occurred, Daisy was blameless.
I knew that something far out of the common line
had caused her to commit the act which had cast a
blight over her reputation. For weeks I could find
no clue. Then, one day, in the street, I saw Hannibal,
the negro for whom she had borrowed my money
and who I supposed was still in France. I cannot
help the quick temper I have inherited, and I confess
that the sight of that fellow aroused my suspicions
against this girl, only they took a new and more horrible
form.</p>

<p>"I remembered distinctly what a strong hold Hannibal
had on the Fern family. I recalled, with frightful
distinctness, the manner in which he attended
Daisy at table, his interest in her health, the $1,000 she
had given him, her quick movement to prevent my
striking him when his answers insulted us both. Perhaps&mdash;but
I will not dilate on the things that came to
my distorted imagination. It was enough for me to
put a detective on his track. I engaged Hazen, and
in three days he came to tell me that a white woman
had passed the night with Hannibal at a house on
Seventh Avenue, the date corresponding with the
one on which I was to have been married!"</p><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span></p>

<p>Gouger listened spellbound. It seemed to him
that the most exciting chapter of this weird tale was
yet to be written.</p>

<p>"If I had lost control of my senses before," pursued
Roseleaf, "what do you suppose happened
when this information was brought to me? But
then I found an excuse for my beloved one. I considered
her the victim of one of those forms of
hypnotism of which there can no longer be any
doubt. She could not have gone there without the
demoniac influence of a stronger personality. He
had charmed her from her home by the exercise of
diabolic arts. My fury was entirely for him. I
sought him at once, only to learn that he had left
the city a few days before, leaving absolutely no
trace. I could not give over the hunt, however. If
he was on the earth I must find him and be avenged
for the wrong he had done. It occurred to me that
an influence so strong as he had exerted would not
be given up. Wherever the Ferns had gone, he
would probably be found. I discovered the whereabouts
of the family, after a great deal of effort, and
went to North Carolina. With the patience of a dog
and the cunning of a fox I laid in wait for weeks,
and one night I saw and heard Daisy Fern and
Hannibal in conversation!"</p>

<p>There was no movement on the part of the critic.
He sat as still as a block of stone.</p>

<p>"When they began to speak I could have sworn
that my recent guesses were correct ones. It was at
about the hour of midnight, and she had crept
quietly and alone out of her house to meet this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
African. But the first dozen sentences that were
uttered gave me a new version of the affair. It was
by no mesmeric power, but by a threat of injury to
her father that this fellow held her under bond. I
learned that Mr. Fern had done something&mdash;I could
not then tell what&mdash;which rendered him liable to
imprisonment. I learned, also, beyond question&mdash;for
they spoke without restraint, supposing themselves
alone&mdash;that, whatever the purpose of Hannibal
when Daisy came to his rooms on the day she
was to have been married, it had not been
accomplished. She was afraid of him, but only for her
father's sake. And I discovered beside, though not
with perfect clearness, that a promise of secrecy accounted
for her refusal to explain the cause of that
absence which had altered the whole course of our
lives.</p>

<p>"I have said I had watched with patience. I
determined to continue my watch till I understood
the entire situation. About once a week they met in
the way I have described, and as the next date was
always arranged in my hearing there was no difficulty
in my keeping the appointment. In the meantime
I learned that Hannibal was born in the vicinity,
that he was living a hermit life, and that nobody
knew of the surreptitious visits he was paying to
Oakhurst. Then one day I heard that Archie was
at the hotel, and thinking it time that I let him into
the secret I went there, pretending I had just arrived
from the north, when in reality I had been boarding
for months five miles away. The rest you know. I
was enabled to prove to him as well as to myself
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>what had actually happened. Since then justice has
been done to us all."</p>

<p>Mr. Gouger had to speak at last.</p>

<p>"To <i>you</i>?" he asked. "Do you admit that all this
is just to you?"</p>

<p>"Without doubt," said Roseleaf. "I forfeited
every right to the woman I had insulted by my suspicions.
There are certain metals that can only be
tried by fire. I was placed in the crucible, and found
wanting."</p>

<p>The critic shook his head sagely.</p>

<p>"You are a regular Roman father to your own
delinquencies," he answered. "But tell me another
thing. Would you have shot Hannibal if Mr. Weil
and Miss Fern had not made their appearance?"</p>

<p>"I have not the least doubt of it. He was in my
eyes at that moment a crawling adder, whose fangs
were liable to penetrate the flesh of some one if he
was not put out of the way. But I am more than
glad I was spared the infliction of his punishment."</p>

<p>Gouger wore a strange look.</p>

<p>"And yet he had one most human quality,"
said he.</p>

<p>"Yes, I admit that now," was the reply. "In his
passionate, barbaric way, he certainly loved. When
I revise my novel I shall try to deal fairly with
him."</p>

<p>"And you will finish it very soon now?"</p>

<p>"As soon as possible."</p>

<p>A month later Lawrence Gouger received at his
office a package marked on the outside, "From Shir<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>ley
Roseleaf." He could hardly control his excitement
until he had untied the strings, taken off the
wrappings and disclosed the tin box inside. It was
a square box, just the right size for manuscript paper
such as he had seen Roseleaf use, and the heart of
the enthusiast beat high as he took it in his hands.
A jewel case filled with the costliest stones would
not have seemed to him more precious. The fame
of a new author would soon resound through the
world! Cutt &amp; Slashem would have the greatest
work of fiction of recent years in their next catalogue!
And he, Lawrence Gouger, would be given
the credit of discovering&mdash;one might almost say of
inventing&mdash;this wonder!</p>

<p>Opening the box, the critic looked at its contents
and then dropped it with an exclamation. It contained
nothing but a small sealed envelope and <i>a
heap of ashes</i>!</p>

<p>Ashes! Ashes made from recently burned
paper!</p>

<p>When he recovered enough to open the envelope,
this note was found within:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">To Lawrence Gouger, Esq:&mdash;Dear Sir</span>: Enclosed
herewith you will find the novel for which you have waited
so long. I hope it will please you in all respects, as I certainly
have taken the greatest pains with it.</p>

<p>"On reading it over I thought it best to more thoroughly
disguise the personality of the characters, lest any of them
might be injured by its publication. There was the happiness
of a newly-made bride to be considered; her husband's
ease of mind; her father's serene old age; her sister's
feelings. There was even a black man who had perhaps
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>suffered enough, and a critic employed by a large publishing
firm who would not like his true character made manifest
in type. In order to protect these people I have applied
a match to the pages. You can best tell whether I
have performed the work too well.</p>

<p>"If this novel does not bring me the fame you anticipate
I shall not much care; I have lost some of my ambitions.
If it fails to add to my fortune, never mind; a single man
has no great need of wealth.</p>

<p>"I go to-night on board a steamer which sails for Europe
at daybreak. When you read this I shall be on the sea. I
have secured a position as resident correspondent abroad
for one of the great newspapers. Perhaps I never shall
return.      Truly your friend,      S. R."</p></div>

<p>"<i>The idiot!</i>" cried the reader, as he finished perusing
this letter. "<i>The imbecile!</i> Was there ever
such a fool born on this earth!"</p>

<p>Then he apostrophised the heap of ashes that lay in
the box before him.</p>

<p>"There never was and never will be so great a work
of fiction as you were yesterday! And yet a little
touch of flame, and all was extinguished! How like
you were to man! Let him have the brain of a
Shakespeare, and a pound weight falling on his skull
ends everything.</p>

<p>"There was a flood in Hungary last week, in which
a thousand people were drowned. There was an
earthquake in Peru where five hundred perished. A
vessel went down off the Caroline Islands. Taken all
together, they did not equal to this world your loss.</p>

<p>"The poet knew what he was saying: 'Great wits
are sure to madness near allied.' Oh, to think that
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>a mind that could execute your thrilling pages knew
no more than to destroy them!</p>

<p>"I will not cast you, sublime ashes, to the winds
of heaven! I will keep you reverently, as one preserves
the cloak of a great man, or the bones of a
mastodon. Behold, I close you again in your
covers, where the eye of no mortal shall henceforth
behold you."</p>

<p>With the words the disappointed critic performed
the action. And to this day visitors to his room
read with wonder the inscription he has placed on
the box:</p>

<p>"<i>The greatest novel that ever was written.</i>"</p>
